The counterperson was very accommodating when asked if I would like to order breakfast at 5 to 11.  I did and he asked the chefs not to put the breakfast acudaments away.  Very kind and great service.

 I was terribly excited to meet my husband for brunch during the work week but was slightly disappointed with my order.  Being vegetarian I thought I might try the biscuit egg dish without the egg and enjoy the tomato jam.  It was over cooked, could hardly bite into the biscuit and the jam far too sweet.

They seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad. We arrived at 10:45 on Sunday but there was no sign of life. We thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11.....kind of odd for a bakery. We had the blueberry hand pie. It was good but probably not worth $6.50.  No espresso drinks but they had drip coffee. We will come back again in the future when they aren't so new.,2016-07-18 02:41:52

So all we ordered were two cookies: the Chai Snickerdoodle and the Peanut Butter Brittle. Both were simply delicious. The snickerdoodle was thick and puffy and soft - and filled with all the warm spices of chai tea. Meanwhile, the PB cookie had rich peanut buttery flavor, but with the sticky, hard crunch of the included bits of peanut brittle.

The bread was delicious,  the sopressata sandwich was divine, as was the green bean artichoke salad.  I was surprised and disappointed that the salad was not accompanied by 1-2 small slices of the baguette. When asked, the server said I could order a 1/2 loaf of the baguette (which I did), though that ended up being just too much.   Also, I would recommend not slicing the whole 1/2 loaf, rather, just make the single cut and leave it to the customer to tear it apart.... I'm hoping what I brought home will taste as good as those I ate with my salad.  All in all the food was very good and I look forward to returning to test other menu items.",2017-02-16 22:53:26

I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious. 

Overall, I'm a huge fan, I would definitely come back if I visited Santa Barbara again. I wish they had a larger variety of baked goods to try!",2018-10-02 03:39:35

I came In to Helena ave really wanting to love it.   
The service was friendly although very slow.   There was a pretty long line though so I know the girl felt flustered and it didn't bother me too much.   
I ordered the quiche, and it was cold. The  assumed eggs would come warmed but you know what assuming does I guess.  
So I Waited in line again to ask have it heated.  And when I got it back the temperature had barely risen. In fact I think she put it in the fridge for a minute not the oven.   It still cold.  Who wants to eat cold eggs!?!

Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt. 
Don't fight the change .... give your customers a little help with the transition and next time we are here perhaps I can give you a star for improvement.

This morning was no different. Sunday at 9 AM, no line yet, and I asked if the egg and cheddar biscuit could be made with sourdough instead, (I was looking at the shelves loaded with their sourdough loaves), but I got an unapologetic ""no, the kitchen doesn't do that"" response. Strike 1. Next, my friend ordered a bagel with cream cheese and tomato slices, and was sorely disappointed in the measly portion of 3 tiny slices of ""crisp"" and utterly flavorless Roma tomatoes that were given. For their prices, one should be getting organic tomatoes, or at least larger, juicier, higher-quality ripe tomatoes. Strike 2. My son and I waited a solid 15 minutes for our egg sandwiches to come out, and watched as others who came in after us received their orders well before us. When we did get the sandwiches, we had to do a careful investigation to find the egg. We had ordered scrambled, and upon close inspection under the ""hood"" we finally found it: the thinnest ""patty"" of egg I have ever encountered, barely to be tasted within all the brioche bun. My 7-year old asked, ""Where's the egg?"" and I should have brought it back up to the manager to show what was actually coming out of the kitchen for $8.  Strike 3. The croissant my daughter ordered was not flaky or fresh (Renaud's is infinitely better) and she left a lot of it on her plate (something she never does). It's too bad, because the location is good, atmosphere OK, and their bagels better than most in the area (lots of chew and tug, hearty).

It was Sunday and the bakery at 11:30 am had sold of nearly out all bread items. My plan of a simple warm sesame bagel with cheese was replaced with  the soup of the day : cream of mushroom a little heavy on the cream accompanied by 2 wedges of buttered sourdough.
I added a Cuban sandwich which was good but unfortunately , the same buttered sourdough was  used making it for a very heavy meal .
For the price, I would have  liked a salad on the side.

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Lets not even discuss the parking situation.

Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery.

I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

The $10 'green egg' (green harissa) biscuit overall was pretty good but the egg inside was not (allowed to spread too thin when being fried and thus much of it was cooked to a dry, paper thin crisp disc).

Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars. 
* The support some local charities and events such as bike to work day and Heal the Oceans.

PS: The address is a bit confusing: if you approach from Anacapa Street, make your way past The Lark and you'll find this bakery next to the SB Wine Collective. They share the same space (so you can have wine with your bagel instead of coffee, if you so wish). It's easier to find if you approach from Helena Avenue.",2017-07-25 21:14:20

MvkzsY6BH6Fb5AABgLyAhg,SsgDGJWBNvefjY0z8XsVCQ,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,5,5,4,5,"Helena Avenue Bakery is a must-visit for those looking for a great breakfast place in Santa Barbara. Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

I really wish I had the opportunity to go again during my trip here. When I come back to SB, I will sure try to come early so I can have breakfast here.",2020-12-27 23:41:14

I walked towards the counter to look at the breakfast menu sometime after 2. There was a large sign that said it was closed but I just wanted to look to see what type of baked goods they may have for tomorrow morning. The young person behind the counter was sweeping, didn't look up, and with a kinda irritated tone declares they were closed. I said  I saw the sign but was looking for tomorrow. She tells me ""you'd be surprised how many people don't read the sign"" with yet another dose of attitude and still not even looking at me. 
So I say well ya know, where I come from, people are greeted when spoken to. She finally looks up and says she did t appreciate my sarcasm. I told her it was more of a life skill I was sharing but ok. Needless to say, I will not be visiting this adorable bakery for breakfast tomorrow.

The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome! Overall though, tourists especially, definitely check out this bakery at least once and try a quality baked good!",2017-08-11 18:21:21

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",2019-11-26 17:59:23

As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

(Ask for extra napkins). Would give five stars but I got the impression the restaurant isn't as dog-friendly as other places around town.",2021-02-05 22:32:41

Line was really long (Saturday morning so it is expected) but couldn't wait for my sourdough toast lol!  As always, the strawberry peppercorn jam is just amazing!  Ordered also a breakfast sandwich on brioche, french toast, avocado toast with a 7 minute egg ($3 extra), an olive loaf, and a pomegranite iced tea.  I would have given this a 4 but the wait was ridiculous after ordering.  The people behind me in line were waiting for 4 coffees for over 20 minutes and my food took 1/2 hour.  With nowhere to sit, only a place to stand by the dirty dish drop off, 1/2 hour is an eternity.  Got home and no egg on the avocado toast to boot.  The brioche sandwich is a bit bland... I only ate 1/2 of it and left the rest on the counter for anyone else to eat and it is still there lol.  My son LOVED the French toast and my daughter said the avo toast was good.  Bummed about the egg though.  Will try again and hopefully it will be not so long... the kids in the kitchen area have no sense of urgency lol but again, good.

I've always appreciated that this bakery has nice treats in a space where you can watch production. However it was charging $1.50 for a coffee refill which was already the most expensive coffee refill in town.  

Now, you'll pay $2 FOR A COFFEE REFILL.  Nope...no mas! I'm done with these clowns regardless of how cute or convenient it is. Businesses can certainly raise prices per some supply and demand curve or supposed ROI or other factors as if they are just spreadsheet driven choices, but there comes a point when actual human beings will be so outraged they'll write the business off completely no matter the justification, and they'll tell everyone they know. Helena Avenue Baker crossed that line today. 

BTW it's not just the coffee refills. You'll find poorly conceived sandwiches don't even start until $11 for a baguette with a couple of pieces of meat and cheese thrown in between. To this business and the Lark's other properties which have gotten wildly rich on the revitalization of the funk zone, ""How much money is enough for you?

I ordered the squash salad as my main dish and my friend got the avo toast sans egg. She really enjoyed hers but it is difficult to mess up avo toast. I have heard from several people that that is their go-to at this place so I may try it one day.

My salad was so so salty. I can't even remember what the rest of it tasted like because I was overwhelmed by the salt. Not sure if they seasoned it too heavily or if the dressing was too heavily salted but I was disappointed as I couldn't taste the squash or squash blossom flavor, or anything else in the dressing. 

I wish that I'd ordered something else. Overall, I would come back for a pastry maybe but probably not a sit-down meal. They don't have a ton of options and they're all pretty expensive.

On the menu you will find baked goods, pies, drinks, artisan bread, and a limited amount of food items. Breakfast is served all day, they make a great brioche breakfast sandwich and smoked salmon bagel. Lunch starts at 11AM, you can choose from a couple sourdough sandwiches, a cheeseboard, or 
Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2.

Very understaffed, probably because of Covid so I get it. Everything looked so delicious I couldn't decide. To help me decide I asked if the ham and cheese sandwich came with the cheese melted. The 17 year old surfer at the register said ""yes"". So I chose it over the pastrami. When I receive it, cheese is definitely not melted. I ask the food runner to run it back to melt the cheese real quick, I don't want to pay $15 for ham and a slice of Swiss. I want a restaurant caliber sandwich. He comes back and tells me , ""we can't melt the cheese"". My husband has, in front of him, a pastrami sandwich with MELTED CHEESE. I take the sandwich up front myself and I ask the manager to just stick the silly sandwich under the broiler for me. No biggie. She says she can't. So I tell her I was specifically informed that it would be melted and now I don't want it. Very nicely. She gives me a blank stare. So I ask her to give me a pastrami sandwich instead. Which she does. My mother in law also ordered the ham sandwich, neither of us got the cornichons that are advertised. 
The thing is, as a cook, I know how easy it is to broil a sandwich. 
So. Excellent bread, terrible ham sandwich without anything to make it worth the $$. Beautiful menu. Don't order the ham sandwich. Nice staff who don't care at all, (no water in the jug though we asked twice), and the staff need to be trained on the menu they're selling. Everything is tasty but for that price they should know how to BROIL SOME CHEESE.

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalapeño jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway.

First of all, the VIBES were amazing. There was a live DJ and it was just such a good ambience. The music was chill and funky, I totally understand why they call it the Funk Zone. 

The patio area was also just beautiful to look at. I loved everything about it.

The food was also super super delicious. I shared the SB Farmers Market Bowl and the turkey sandwich with a friend. The bowl was the absolute star of the show (see my picture). I'm not even a big healthy food person, but this bowl was out of this world. The mushrooms were the best part for sure. SO flavorful.

This is one of the biggest breakfast sandwich I've ever had, I barely finished it...now it's making me want to go back to sleep as I write this review. This sandwich is probably going to keep me full until dinner. The biscuit was slightly crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy at the same time. The flavor is always consistent and I really like the green harissa sauce so I always ask for extra.

Most places mess up on their chicken sandwiches because they put all the unnecessary sauces on it and the batter to the fried chicken isn't crispy, or no flavor or too much batter, and the chicken is dry. This chicken is juicy, tender, perfect batter where it's the perfect light airy crunch! No sauce sauce is on it, not needed. Fried bacon on top of the fried chicken and the jalapeño jam sauce (very light) with the brioche bun, is all the flavor it needs!! Bacon is nice and thick. It's not being engulfed with sauce hiding all the imperfection, because it's perfect! The buns is so light and fluffy with the perfect sweetness. 

The challah French toast- perfect sweetness with the honey and the grapefruit is spectacular!!! It's juicy and crunchy. The bread is soooo soft and fluffy.

Please know if you are vegan you can sub eggs for avocado but watch how they ring you up.  The Lovely gal timing me up added $3 for avocado  but she fixed it when I pointed it out as a sub.   

Why not five stars:  $1 extra for non dairy milk option.  To many places have up charges for lactose intolerant folks.  Note: Old town Goleta does NOT upcharge for healthy plant based non dairy milks.

We were staying in the area and had heard about this bakery which was known for some great breakfast sandwich items so we stopped by.

Breakfast sandwich: 3/5
Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more.

Chicken sandwich: 4/5
After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side.

The green eggs and ham on brioche is my go-to; it doesn't taste like any old breakfast sandwich because of that delicious green harissa! I didn't like the farmer's market sandwich on brioche because it was really soggy, perhaps from the Swiss chard.

I recently spent a long weekend in Santa Barbara with my family and close friends that are renting a house in the area for the month.  Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

Hope to visit again on future visits to Santa Barbara, and hopefully do a wine tasting with you as well!",2018-07-16 17:06:04

Ordered the green eggs and ham and it was actually quite filling. The square egg was fluffy and soft. Brioche bun was delicious and has a slight crisp which I loved.

The nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy!

Aaaaanyway, definitely come here for brunch bites and coffee.",2018-06-20 21:05:17

Stopped by on a busy Sunday morning and service was still quick and friendly.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich on brioche (baked egg, smoked cheddar, bacon, and butter), a matcha latte, and a pumpkin loaf to-go.  The sandwich was delicious -- the egg is really the star of the show here! The matcha latte wasn't blended thoroughly and it was grainy making it hard to drink, I opted for a cup of water after a few sips. The pumpkin loaf was the perfect amount of sweet and a nice complement to my morning coffee the next day.  Aside from the food, the ambience here is very casual with both indoor and outdoor seating.  Location is prime, there is a public parking garage behind the bakery and it's only a few blocks away from the beach!",2021-12-20 19:58:43

I spent almost $30 for the sandwich + tip. I also didn't love the peppered chips, but I will still give this good scoring because the bread, meat, and everything in between was very good. Service was great, and speedy too.",2022-01-09 05:38:26
