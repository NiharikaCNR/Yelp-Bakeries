So I ordered an espresso drink to go. I waited 15 minutes for that drink! Why only one barista on a busy Saturday morning? The owners should re-open Lucky Penny for breakfast because Helena Bakery is busier than they can handle (and I want my wood-fired eggs!)

We were the only ones waiting for food. It took them 15 minutes to toast a mediocre bagel and put it in a box with capers, cream cheese, and onions, pre-packaged separately based on the 5 days prior date scrawled in sharpie on the plastic cup (they forgot my tomatoes). Not very cute for the mom-and-pop vibe they have going.

Barista was fast at least. Good latte and cold brew. I should have just ordered a pastry though.",2018-03-04 17:37:14

The counterperson was very accommodating when asked if I would like to order breakfast at 5 to 11.  I did and he asked the chefs not to put the breakfast acudaments away.  Very kind and great service.

 I was terribly excited to meet my husband for brunch during the work week but was slightly disappointed with my order.  Being vegetarian I thought I might try the biscuit egg dish without the egg and enjoy the tomato jam.  It was over cooked, could hardly bite into the biscuit and the jam far too sweet.  

Oh well, perhaps I will just have coffee next time because that was delicious.",2017-08-08 22:39:34
4YAj-NY_uP6J9I28bbCXaQ,0CUDrMaBZaQUU0xX0fYRpA,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,2,2,0,0,I had really high expectations for this bakery since I'm a pastry chef myself. They seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad. We arrived at 10:45 on Sunday but there was no sign of life. We thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11.....kind of odd for a bakery. We had the blueberry hand pie. It was good but probably not worth $6.50.  No espresso drinks but they had drip coffee. We will come back again in the future when they aren't so new.,2016-07-18 02:41:52

I came In to Helena ave really wanting to love it.   
The service was friendly although very slow.   There was a pretty long line though so I know the girl felt flustered and it didn't bother me too much.   
I ordered the quiche, and it was cold. The  assumed eggs would come warmed but you know what assuming does I guess.  
So I Waited in line again to ask have it heated.  And when I got it back the temperature had barely risen. In fact I think she put it in the fridge for a minute not the oven.   It still cold.  Who wants to eat cold eggs!?!

The two people in front of me were visibly frustrated for different reasons (one ordered takeout and got their order on a plate and one had been waiting a while for their coffee and the wrong drink was made). Our pastries were good but not outstanding. The cinnamon roll had a ton of sweet icing without a taste of creamcheese (I think it was a sugar icing). And not a lot of cinnamon taste either.

Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt. 
Don't fight the change .... give your customers a little help with the transition and next time we are here perhaps I can give you a star for improvement.

No more cinnamon rolls or donuts now it's just a sugar coated morning bun. And adding bacon to their egg and tomato biscuit sandwiches was really not necessary they were good before. The first time I ordered 2 and realized that there was bacon in them I drove back and asked them to remake it and when I checked them again the egg they put inside was so tiny and thin I literally thought it wasn't in there and drove to the store to buy eggs just so it could have more filling!

TkJAXxeXxk1cv_aVfNdzUw,GjSaefh6mxCErvThiOQWpw,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,2,0,0,0,"So I live in Santa Barbara and have visited the bakery on multiple occasions, always walking away unimpressed and slightly irritated. This morning was no different. Sunday at 9 AM, no line yet, and I asked if the egg and cheddar biscuit could be made with sourdough instead, (I was looking at the shelves loaded with their sourdough loaves), but I got an unapologetic ""no, the kitchen doesn't do that"" response. Strike 1. Next, my friend ordered a bagel with cream cheese and tomato slices, and was sorely disappointed in the measly portion of 3 tiny slices of ""crisp"" and utterly flavorless Roma tomatoes that were given. For their prices, one should be getting organic tomatoes, or at least larger, juicier, higher-quality ripe tomatoes. Strike 2. My son and I waited a solid 15 minutes for our egg sandwiches to come out, and watched as others who came in after us received their orders well before us. When we did get the sandwiches, we had to do a careful investigation to find the egg. We had ordered scrambled, and upon close inspection under the ""hood"" we finally found it: the thinnest ""patty"" of egg I have ever encountered, barely to be tasted within all the brioche bun. My 7-year old asked, ""Where's the egg?"" and I should have brought it back up to the manager to show what was actually coming out of the kitchen for $8.  Strike 3. The croissant my daughter ordered was not flaky or fresh (Renaud's is infinitely better) and she left a lot of it on her plate (something she never does). It's too bad, because the location is good, atmosphere OK, and their bagels better than most in the area (lots of chew and tug, hearty).

1. The system for getting your food is horrible.  They yell your name and put the food on top of a pastry display case.  Clueless tourists will push you and step on your feet, as you try to get through to pick up your food, so be very careful.

2. The bread is excellent, but the cooked food is not hot.  Cold egg sandwiches and lukewarm latte are unacceptable.

3. Don't wear sandals or other open toed shoes at the inside tables.  I almost sliced my foot.  The clamps that keep the wheels on the tables from moving are knife sharp.  They need to be wrapped with insulation or removed completely.

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Lets not even discuss the parking situation.

Honestly, the LA hipsters can have this place.  It's good but not good enough to justify the cost or the trouble",2019-12-10 20:40:11

There were several different breakfast sandwiches on the menu. We were looking for just a quick bit. Simple pastries, donuts etc. The place calls itself a bakery, so I assumed the croissants, pastries, and donuts would be very fresh. This was not the case. I had a ham & cheese croissant, which was ok, but not that fresh, flakey etc. My daughter ordered the ""seasonal donut"" which was $4.00. It was just an iced cake donut with colored sprinkles. Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery. Am I wrong for assuming the baked goods would be fresh and better than average? If you're going to charge me $4.00 for a donut, it better be the best darn donut I ever ate. Next time we're in town, we'll try somewhere else.",2018-06-05 20:17:54

Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt. 
Don't fight the change .... give your customers a little help with the transition and next time we are here perhaps I can give you a star for improvement.

PJQkFOalE8aEexb9xiL3Zg,Xp5Hj2SGl0eDp3Ine9a_vg,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,1,15,0,0,"This is a tough review to write, because I have been a devoted take-out customer of Helena Avenue Bakery since they opened. I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

The morning bun was not just-out-of-the-oven fresh and for $5 was basically a rip-off.  Morning buns need to be made in small batches and sold within a couple of hours of baking.  Ours was air-stale, hard, dry, and unappealing.

The $10 'green egg' (green harissa) biscuit overall was pretty good but the egg inside was not (allowed to spread too thin when being fried and thus much of it was cooked to a dry, paper thin crisp disc).  I suggest these folks take a field trip up to Pine State Biscuits in Portland, OR to see a better product being served at a better price.

Once I paid for my order I waited by the counter for 25 minutes while they prepared my plate.  During that time three different workers rearranged the accoutrements on the plate with their bare hands, picking up and replacing each piece of cheese like they were working on a Rubik's Cube.  While I appreciate having a nice presentation it seemed a little ridiculous to have three people not wearing gloves reorganize the dish while I stood there and watched.  Finally after the 25 minutes of charcuterie design I brought the cheese plate to my table.  It came with a ramekin full of seven almonds and no crackers.  Since we wanted something crunchy to go with our cheese I walked back up to the counter to ask for more almonds to which they told me I could NOT have extra.  I then asked the employee if I could purchase more almonds for ANY amount of money.  The employee responded ""NO"".

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",2019-11-26 17:59:23

Businesses can certainly raise prices per some supply and demand curve or supposed ROI or other factors as if they are just spreadsheet driven choices, but there comes a point when actual human beings will be so outraged they'll write the business off completely no matter the justification, and they'll tell everyone they know. Helena Avenue Baker crossed that line today. 

BTW it's not just the coffee refills. You'll find poorly conceived sandwiches don't even start until $11 for a baguette with a couple of pieces of meat and cheese thrown in between. To this business and the Lark's other properties which have gotten wildly rich on the revitalization of the funk zone, ""How much money is enough for you? At any point, do you feel a responsibility to provide a fair priced service to the community?""",2018-06-11 16:07:35

I ordered the squash salad as my main dish and my friend got the avo toast sans egg. She really enjoyed hers but it is difficult to mess up avo toast. I have heard from several people that that is their go-to at this place so I may try it one day.

My salad was so so salty. I can't even remember what the rest of it tasted like because I was overwhelmed by the salt. Not sure if they seasoned it too heavily or if the dressing was too heavily salted but I was disappointed as I couldn't taste the squash or squash blossom flavor, or anything else in the dressing. 

I wish that I'd ordered something else. Overall, I would come back for a pastry maybe but probably not a sit-down meal. They don't have a ton of options and they're all pretty expensive.

I ask the food runner to run it back to melt the cheese real quick, I don't want to pay $15 for ham and a slice of Swiss. I want a restaurant caliber sandwich. He comes back and tells me , ""we can't melt the cheese"". My husband has, in front of him, a pastrami sandwich with MELTED CHEESE. I take the sandwich up front myself and I ask the manager to just stick the silly sandwich under the broiler for me. No biggie. She says she can't. So I tell her I was specifically informed that it would be melted and now I don't want it. Very nicely. She gives me a blank stare. So I ask her to give me a pastrami sandwich instead. Which she does. My mother in law also ordered the ham sandwich, neither of us got the cornichons that are advertised. 
The thing is, as a cook, I know how easy it is to broil a sandwich. 
So. Excellent bread, terrible ham sandwich without anything to make it worth the $$. Beautiful menu. Don't order the ham sandwich. Nice staff who don't care at all, (no water in the jug though we asked twice), and the staff need to be trained on the menu they're selling.

So i'm not too impressed with the grocery items.  I briefly checked out their seafood section and it all looked pretty fresh - that part is better than the Von's.  For groceries and specialty items i think i will stick with Lazy Acres which is about the same price as Gelson's (but not for General Mills cereal)!

The nice thing about Whole Foods is that they segregate the organic/non-organic salad items, so you can steer clear of any pesticide laden ingredients.

Occasionally, I'll pop in for a fresh warm baguette, if I'm in the neighborhood. (I think Gelson's has the best baguettes in town.) I only get to Gelson's around 4 times a year. 

However, I recently found that Gelson's is the only place in town that carries Beyond Burgers Cookout Classic, which is a great-tasting veggie burger, so in the last month, I've gone by Gelson's to buy those burgers. And while I'm there, I tend to fill up the cart with whatever looks good. Baguettes, French butter, a Renaud's pecan pie, Broguiere's egg nog, Pascucci salad dressing, local pinots, and organic produce. I usually hit up the deli pretty hard too for sliced meats, prepared salmon, specialty cheeses, and fancy crackers.

Today, however, was a total bummer. I popped in at 3:00 on a Monday, hoping there wouldn't be a line and I could get in and out quickly and minimize the risk of covid exposure. Getting in was a breeze - no wait. And getting out was easy - all checkout stands had cashiers to keep them moving. But the part in between sucked.

I was looking for a certain cheese I got at Lazy or Whole Foods and wanted to ask about it at the cheese counter. No one was there, and of course, the guy in the pizza area didn't know. I figured I'd get some sliced ham and maybe when I was done, someone would be at the cheese counter. So, I went over to the sliced meats and waited with about 5 other people for help. There was one person helping the line and it wasn't moving, as more people queued up. The deli was turning into a cage fight, with one employee filling orders, so after waiting 5 minutes and the line not moving, I went back to the speciality cheeses. Still no one there, but I asked an employee walking by and he called over a manager to help me. The manager said he would call the cheese lady and left, so I waited another few minutes and looked around at the Xmas display nearby. When I looked up, there was a woman in the cheese area, so as I walked over, I said ""Hi!"" She had her back to me, writing in a notebook and I figured she didn't hear me, so when I got to the counter, I said ""Hi"" again. Nothing. ""Hello"" again. No response; she just kept writing and flipping through her binder. I stood there, looking at her back, watching her work, and waited 3-4 minutes. Another staff person walked through the cheese area to the back and looked at me, but didn't say anything. After 5 minutes of staring at the cheese lady's back and watching her work, I gave up and left. 

Total today came to just over $250. I'm sure I'll be back for the veggie burgers, but I'm done with shopping at the deli and cheese counters. It's a very busy section of the store, and it feels like they're doing nothing to distance customers from each other or staff appropriately to get people in and out of that area quickly. Furthermore, the customer service was nonexistent in that whole area, lending to the cage fight feel of it, with customers jockeying for position at the painfully slow-moving stations.

The store expansion is beautiful with the gift basket area, produce, and expanded wine offerings. However, the customer service and staffing in the left side of the store from the speciality cheeses to the deli meats seems to have really slipped to the point where I'm over it.",2020-12-15 03:00:20

The white ones with the red fire truck pattern.  I was watching my father sitting on the couch bent over lacing up his boots with those leather laces that he insisted upon.  As he laced them up, he recited his morning pep talk to himself: ""Another day, another dollar, another day closer to the grave.""  What has this to do with Gelson's?  It appears their business model is ""Every product at least a dollar more than our nearest competitor.""  You know the store's mission statement on the wall?  The one that talks about quality, convenience and whatever?  They could well append ""every product at least a dollar more than our nearest competitor."" to that mission statement.

I can tolerate paying a dollar more.  I aimed for the moon when I planned for retirement and hit a bush.  A bush isn't bad.  I could afford all those groceries, but my father's voice rattled through my head with that stern tone and those eyes that see to the far reaches of the soul 
making one involuntarily quiver as he says, ""Watch the nickles and the dimes!  The dollars will take care of themselves!""  I had to remove the half dozen items I planned to purchase and put them all back.  I went up the street to the store that has the same stuff for a dollar less.

What irreparable damage has my father done to me by the imprint of the myriad of ""kodak moments"" of my childhood?  I don't know.  A droll sense of humor? Maybe.  Cynical? Okay.  Afraid?

The pita, which is the staple of the region)  was store bought, flat, flavorless, and cold.  The ""shwarma,"" was just over cooked chicken (not from the rotisserie) and it was slathered in some mayo, which has nothing whatever to do with the cuisine either.  Then there's the falafel:  was it falafel?  I am not sure, as it felt and taste more like deeply over fried paper. Oh, and I haven't mentioned the lack of flavor and service?  How about the lack of garnishes, and salads that are the staple of all dishes in a fresh Middle Eastern diet?  Just awful in every way.  I have been in Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Israel, Algeria, and of course all over the EU and England, where there is amazing Mid East food.  Don't be fooled into thinking this represents our culture of welcoming and sharing, or abundance of healthy flavorful eats, just because it's Santa Barbara and there is only the slightly better Zaytoon to compare.

There was a stage in the back for live shows so I can imagine it could get fun after 6pm when the shows start.  Overall the wine was pretty good. It's not your traditional winery and has a cool spin on each wine and what they are named after. I really enjoyed the owner who is a Turkish guy and i love Turks. He explained how certain wines were named after his dogs. I thought that was the theme so I asked what dog the next wine was named after and he responded.... ""This is named after my Mom"".  I proceeded to tell him that ""I enjoyed his Mom"". Things kind of went downhill from there.

The in-house roaster is a treat for the senses when it's running. The desserts are okay, nothing special but they hit the spot if you're in need of a coffee and sugar rush. The coffees are generally excellent, but the last time I visited, in December 2009, it seemed the beans had been underroasted or perhaps stored too long. 
The Mexico Altura, which I bought whole-bean for a drip machine and a Chemex glass coffeemaker, was stale and bland. The beans had none of the essential oil that even a medium roast needs for full taste. I was also disappointed in the Montecito Blend, normally a great coffee from Santa Barbara Roasting Co.
But I base my generally positive review on my previous experiences, where both the in-house servings and the take-home beans were spectacular, bold and full of taste. I also just love the place. It's comfortable and always available and just a nice place to relax in the beautiful town where I grew up.

It seemed he would glance over from the opposite side and say, ""I'll be right back"" to his other table, and then come pour for us and run back to his other table without giving us any information on the wine we were drinking. Towards the end, the other table had left, so he came by to pour us our last pour from the tasting, and to tell us his wines were named after his kids or something.

I love this coffee shop! Before I start with the bad, I will focus on the good. The service is always great, the people who work there are awesome and super friendly.  So, you are probably wondering why I'm giving it a two star rating. It is because of their somewhat recent change in pastries. The coffee is still good and I always pick up an iced coffee when I'm getting a fruit bowl next door, but their new pastries are awful. The fan favorite (or my favorite) was the cornbread raspberry muffins, but ever since they switched suppliers they have gone downhill. I probably sound like a pretentious prude, but I really want to help. I hope the owner or manager reads this and I hope I'm not the only one that feels this way. Keep in mind, of the new pastries, I have only tried the scones, muffins, and croissant a few times. Also, their vegan donuts are not too bad, but the muffins and scones are extremely bland and by bland I mean they taste like flour. I hope they consider changing back to the old supplier of pastries or look elsewhere for tastier options.

No pressure to buy. If you want to try a wine tasting room with an atmosphere different than any other tasting room, it is worth the stop just to see what some of these tiny producers can do.

Middle of the day relaxation with perfectly pulled Americano? Handlebar. Lazy Saturday afternoon hangout with friends? RoCo.

Their coffee delivers, but doesn't transport. Their espresso drinks--especially the caps--seem a little overwrought and sweet, but that's just a stylistic opinion. Also, I've noticed the spro' drinks vary greatly depending on who is at the machine. I suppose that can be true of any coffee shop. The vibe of RoCo is what keeps me coming back, however. Homeless guys and local weirdos abound, and the bathroom may smell gawdawul, but it's home, it's local, and let's keep it that way. Good view of the mountains, too.

We even lied to the guy pouring the drinks, and told him we were further down the list of tastings - this was just so we could skip some of the vile offerings.

The locals call it ROKO and have for decades.    On Saturday mornings it is my go-to place for a cup of Java and a bagel.   

I like it because it is cheap!   I like it because it is pretty good.   I like it because the employees are top notch!  I like it because I always run into a friend.

A little secret about me is that I like to ""people watch"" and Roko is a great place to do that.  There is the guy on his computer with the headphones and antennas, dozens of chords and peripheral devices.   Looks like a little mini NORAD sitting on the  table.   There is a constant stream of Yoga-girls all carrying their rolled up mats.   Always a lot of people stopping in on the way to work and a lot of people who don't know how to spell work.   Old people, young people, pretty people, less than pretty people.  Roko is Santa Barbara's melting pot.  

Coffee is self-serve so no charge for refills.   The breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches are inexpensive and generous (but pre-made),  You cut your bagels with their guillotine while shouting Viva La France or Let Them Eat Cake!  All things that make this place worth while. 

On the negative side people smoke right next to the wide open doors and the place often reeks of cigarette smoke.  There is a sign telling them to be 15 feet from the doors but they don't pay any attention to it.    Bathrooms are rarely clean and sometimes you have to wait a while as someone is taking a bath in the sink.  

So if you have been on a run and want a place you can grap a cuppa without going home to clean up, or just want to soak in some of SB's wonderful culture I would suggest going there.

I ordered their ""European Breakfast"", including a croissant, a couple pieces of toast, and a coffee. All they needed to do was to heat them up, and how long would that take? Well, we first waited for half an hour, but our food didn't come. I asked the waiter to check on our food. He said there was a mistake in the kitchen and they forgot about us, but they would bring me the food very soon. Then another half an hour passed, still no food. That's already ONE HOUR waiting time for a croissant, toasts, and a bowl of fruits (my boyfriend ordered). The guy working at cashier came to check on us and I told him it's been about an hour and I was still waiting for my two pieces of toast and a croissant. He went to the kitchen and found out that the food was ready on the counter for a long time, but no one brought it out for us. He apologized and said he WOULD NOT CHARGE me, so I said OK. Since they have this machine that makes you pay and TIP when you order, so I assumed he would give me a refund. The croissant was OK but the toast was burned. Since it was going to be a free meal, we just ate and left, didn't bother to complain. BUT GUESS WHAT? They still CHARGED ME, no refund. Bad service is one thing, but lying to the customer is much much worse!! I decided to contact the business before writing this one-start review, thinking maybe they didn't mean to lie to me, maybe they just forgot. 

I sent the business a message on Yelp, explaining my experience. They got back to me the next day, apologized and said they were happy to refund me when I was available on the phone. I emailed them back, thanked them for their response and said I'd love to get my refund. I also left my phone number and email address so that they can contact me, since they did not leave me any contact information. And guess what? They never got back to me again. 

So here it is, my very unfortunate experience with this highly-reviewed place. What makes me really mad is that they ask for tip when you order your food, before you are served.

My girlfriend and I had a very nice dinner at home on a friday night. We both are very busy in our daily lives and also cook most of the week. After dinner and in the middle of a movie, I realized we were lacking sweets at home. I decided to make a quick run to Gelsons on upper State St. and browse Renaud's pastry section. I asked Alicia, a Renaud's employee, if they had croissants with almonds and she abruptly said, ""we're out"". I understand it was 7:45pm and they close at 8, but I felt as if I was intruding or interrupting her conversation with a co-worker. After feeling surprised with her reaction, I sternly asked if there was another part of the store that may carry them. She quickly pointed at a lady halfway down the store aisle and said, the store manager is over there, you should ask her. I was shocked! I walked around the packaged pastry dept, next to the Renaud's section and decided to return to Alicia and comment how helpful she was. BTW, this was not the first time this happened with this gal. The last time was similar, but I decided not to react as she may be having a bad day. Tonight, I realized it was not the case. 

I will only write this one review as I will not be returning to any Renaud's, nor Gelsons again.

I do think that their brewed coffee is over roasted, and always tastes burnt. While I haven't tried every blend, there isn't a single brew that I can tolerate.  I tried their nitro cold brew, which I think tries too hard. It's expensive (7 dollars) and tastes more like watered down Guinness than it does iced coffee. Not a fan. The espresso is just fine though (because it's supposed to be a darker roast), and I stick to that.

They no longer honor the Axxess deal as of this year, which is a bummer. People do seem to love it here though. The customer base is incredibly friendly and this is a regular meeting spot for locals.

Addition: there's also this loud, deep humming sound that I assume comes from the roasting machine. It's a low pitch, so while it's easy to hear over it, the sound burrows into your eardrums.

Maybe a kind or even remotely friendly conversation would have gotten us to return to try the wine for ourselves. With that response? Not a chance. His demeanor is not appropriate for customer service. He got one star for the horrendous attitude and his response wasn't in any way apologetic. People have bad days but he seems to have more bad ones than good ones, according to the other reviews. 

I wish you luck. You will need it, judging the empty establishment I witnessed, the public has spoken.",2016-11-11 15:33:43

However, this is where the good vibes end. The wines we tasted at Sevtap are the worst I have ever had, and I am an enthusiastic consumer of Santa Barbara County (and Trader Joes $4.99) wines! Our group of four came in after tasting at Au Bon Climat, so maybe our palettes were a bit fussy, but truly everything that touched out lips at Sevtap would have been much more at home in a children's juice box than a wine glass. Each was too sweet by far (and don't even get me started on the Syrah), and we tried quite a few just to be sure it wasn't us! 

I hesitated to post this, but ultimately shuddered to think of some other unsuspecting party of wine enthusiasts thinking this would be a good stop on the urban wine trail. Steer clear if you're looking for good wine!!",2021-06-23 22:41:36

Moley, moley, moley, moley, moley!

Been to the Old Town Goleta location a few times
This is small. Very small. And tucked in the corner of the shopping strip, not directly on Milpas. Out of the 25 seats, 17 were filled on a weekend lunch. 
Thought about the Barbacoa $9.75 or Menudo $9.75 as they are only available on the weekends. Went instead, based on Yelp reviews, with the Mole plate ringing in at $9.25.

Smokey, thick and sweet, the mole smothered the chicken. Mess for sure but also delicious. This could be the best mole in town. And the tortillas were light and fluffy goodness. 

Have a sweet tooth or craving for pastry treats? La Tapatia Bakery has you covered. One entire wall's bins are filled with delight.

This is a divey spot. The kind you walk into and know you're are in the right place for authentic, whatever it is they serve. It looks, feels and is the real deal. Yum. It's cramped with a few two tops and large, family style tables. Pull up a seat and make new friends. Will help if you habla español but not required to enjoy this delicious experience.

I was excited to see they had Kona coffee pour-overs, so I ordered a small one, a spinach feta croissant and a strawberry Danish ($9 total). The croissant was okay, but it was small and lacked filling. The Danish was quite good in the same way that a pastry from Costco can be quite good. The coffee was not good - it was actually awful to the point where it might as well have been Folgers instant coffee. They roast the beans on site but the end result was sadly a waste of Kona beans. They were roasting as I sat there and the aroma was of burnt beans, confirming that roasting is where it all begins to go wrong. I found three places in SB with good coffee: Green Star Coffee (in the Public market), Handlebar, and the Helena Avenue Bakery (who brews Dart coffee). The ""RoCo"" space is nice enough, if you're not as fussy as me about your coffee. 

I'm giving SB Roasting Co. 2/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons: 

* They don't have anything to say about sourcing of the majority of their beans (other than their ""Naturally Grown"" beans) and as a result it comes across that they are making commodity market purchases. 
* A few of their coffee beans come under their ""Naturally Grown"" label, which they say signifies that the coffee is organic, shade-grown and fair trade. It's strange that they don't use the official Organic or Fair Trade logos. I want to believe but the provided information is sketchy. The Green Star rating could be 2 stars or 4, depending on the authenticity of this label and also where they source their other beans (the majority of their coffee). 
* The server couldn't tell me where the pastries were sourced & it's not stated online. 
* I asked for the coffee in a ceramic cup, but they gave it to me in a double paper cup.
* Cups, lids, and cold-cups are not compostable.
* Packaging for beans is Mylar.

As a buyer I'd like a package roasted within a few days sealed properly and dated. 

They roast coffee daily but apparently that coffee isn't for sale. No indicators of dates when the coffee was roasted besides them telling you it's within a few days. 

The coffee that is by made by the batch is subpar and acidic. If you want a quick cup of coffee to go (assuming you've found parking in this crowded area) this place is for you.

Yes they sell Silvergreens sandwiches and salads. That's nice. 
They probably make great fancy coffee drinks for which you pay too much. 
But 5 months a year in SB, this place is an oven. 
I parked in the lot before my cheap massage at Little Rainbow Spa and got a glass of ice water and a SB power bar. It was 70 and breezy outside. Inside, over 80 with a bunch of comatose individuals on laptops or reading. 
One of the many annoyances of SB is the citywide aversion to a/c. Do SB people think it's a plot of Satan that gives you cancer? 2 million dollar houses have no a/c. Some new fancy houses are plumbed for it, but the owners don't even install central air. 
It's a pretty place which is however uninhabitable for anyone who doesn't like living by the equator (or Phoenix).

SERVICE -

The server behind the cash register was a bit uppish and very impatient with customers. When I had entered, it was as if I was wasting his time if I didn't order the moment I arrived. I sat down inside and watched for awhile how he treated customers and I was not a fan of it. It was so bad that I had to sit outside and not only enjoy the weather but to get away from his bad vibes.

FOOD -

I ordered their croissant, oatmeal raisin cookies, and their delectable macarons in Black Current and Calamansi. I wish the server behind the cash register would have at least heated them up, nonetheless the pastries were delicious!

It may seem like little stuff: a generally unfriendly staff, weird rules about bus staff not helping with drink refills (""if I do it for you, I have to do it for everybody.""), or the odd choice to strictly limit menu items based on time of day or day of week (you can have a ham & cheese croissant in the morning but not in the afternoon when you have to order the French Cubano sandwich with no pickles to get the same thing, and you can't have it on the weekends unless you order the ham & cheese & EGG croissant and tell them to hold the egg -which you have to still pay for.

When the omelet came it was just okay and pretty bland. They didn't offer to refund us for the French toast and the food was expensive.

The baristas were friendly and helped me choose between a cafe latte and a cafe au lait.  For the cafe au lait, I was able to choose my own coffee and they just poured the milk in for me. I also ordered a blackberry oat scone but wasn't really impressed. I didn't like how the blackberry bits were tough and difficult to chew. It may have been better if the blackberry was turned into a coulis or something and then used without the seeds (just my opinion).

Overall, cute spot and parking was relatively easy to find on the street but that may have been only because it was a holiday!

The menu features numerous lattes, a cold brew, and other specialty drinks. I ordered the basic black coffee. After paying $2.65, I was handed an empty cardboard cup with no direction. I took the cup and searched for the coffee dispensers, which were lined up on a counter in the back. There were several options of seemingly good quality coffee. After trying a few, I went with the Paradise Blend. It was good and had a nice bold and sweet taste to it. It would have been better if it was freshly made and not stored in a giant coffee thermos for a few hours.

Storing the coffee in thermoses is an efficient way to serve black coffee and provide refills.  The shop has plenty of seating and tables, so it makes sense for customers that are spending a few hours here, not so much if you are looking for a fresh quality cup of coffee.",2017-07-01 13:08:48

If we aren't welcome in any seat then why did someone tell me that we could sit down in this one?

I used to love its fun and friendly atmosphere.  Since I've moved back home, I've come back to Java Station several times. I have been appalled at the conduct of the employees and some of the patrons. 

As a young woman, I have recently felt uncomfortable and sometimes unsafe. Firstly, not only are the employees surly but they appear to be unclean. It is unhygienic for the male and female employees to wear their down while preparing food. Additionally, the food service is very slow. 

Secondly, some of the male patrons have made myself and friends uncomfortable. After my experience today, I will never go back. As my sister and I were leaving Java Station, a disheveled man closely followed us to my car. He stood closely and stared as we got into the car. He then approached my car, started touching my license plate and reciting my license plate number to himself. As I started to sit in the driver's seat he stood very close to me, touching the car and asking where we were going. We refused to tell him and drove away. It made my sister and I feel extremely uncomfortable and scared for our safety. 

I will never again bring my business to Java Station. It is an environment where the employees not only tolerate inappropriate behavior, but seem to condone it.

Long story:
I was researching online about different places to study at, and this cafe came up and after reading through some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try today... and it was hands-down the WORST experience I've ever had at any cafe/restaurant in my life, and I was only there for a couple minutes. 
The worker didn't even bother to greet/talk to a paying customer, and instead turned around to complain to his fellow coworker who was leaving. He didn't even tell me when my coffee was ready. I was standing near the display case just looking around the place and after a couple minutes, I randomly looked up and saw that the worker was looking at me and then he flicked his eyes towards the counter to where my drink was sitting. Again, no words. How did he even get the job? I'm assuming he's related to the owner... 
So I get my drink (chai latte, since the reviews here said that it was good) and get the heck out of there. Once I tried the drink, I vowed never to go back again and to just stick with Starbucks. It was basically just chai tea with a few drops of milk and a thick foam top. Obviously the worker can't even use an espresso machine correctly... 
I definitely will not be going back, and will tell others to avoid this place as well.",2013-03-20 14:17:37

He avoided eye contact and acted as disinterested as possible in our perusing of the menu. From everything we could tell, there were no specific menu items--just a board that listed what kinds of breads, meats, cheeses and so on that you could build your own sandwich with. When my wife started ordering he shoved a piece of paper at her with a list of ingredients and a pencil to, presumably, make her order official by actually listing the ingredients she wanted. Since she had already made her order vocally, while she was filling out the form he walked into the back and grabbed a few items, including a large jar of mayo, walked back out and dropped them on the table as if he was being grievously inconvenienced.

I ordered an onion bagel with cream cheese -- and there was mold on the bagel. I pointed it out to the counter person, but he insisted it wasn't mold. He didn't offer me a new bagel. Needless to say, I won't be ordering that again. 

And the coffee used to be good and hot -- but lately it has been watery and cold. Maybe they are trying to stretch those coffee bean dollars, but its definitely not what it once was. 

And to top it off, the internet service used to be fast and reliable -- now it is so slow I feel like I am on a dailup modem. 

I will be looking for a new favorite coffee shop, because Java Station is no longer it.

And oh ya -- the owner has a toddler he keeps in the shop, and it constantly screams ""daaaaady!!!"" at the top of its lungs. Many customers look up when this happens, and I have seen people leave.

First, for reference, I eat at this place about once or twice a week, sometimes at the other locations. 

Pretty much everything is good, from the pastries to entrees. The eggs are great and the food is fresh and high quality. 

The service is nearly always friendly, but recently we've had some weird problems that we haven't had at other locations.

First, if you go on the weekends during their breakfast rush, you'll likely encounter the woman whose job it is to seat people and organize the flow of customers. She really needs to calm down and stop and listen. She asks a lot of questions about how many people in your party and about your seating preference, but she's so frenetic and scattered that people who arrive 10 minutes after us end up being seated before us because she doesn't remember that we said we'd sit anywhere. Having this happen once or twice is maybe understandable, but it's par for the course with her. 

Also, the counter staff seem baffled by basic things like ordering a latte ""breve"" style. I've taken to asking for a latte made with half and half instead of milk and that still throws them. 

Recently, I went in at 1:30 and I was one of only two people in the place. When I tried to place my order the girl at the register said, ""Sorry, our kitchen closes at 2."" I asked if I could order a sandwich or salad and she repeated, ""Sorry, our kitchen closes at 2. You could get a pastry, whatever's left..."" The case was nearly empty. I asked why they stopped taking orders at 1:30 for lunch if they close at 2 and she just looked at me, irritated now and said, ""SORRY. OUR KITCHEN CLOSES AT 2."" 

I got the feeling they were having a slow day and were hoping to leave early.

Finally, on a recent visit, I ordered the delicious huevos rancheros and the sour cream that is usually generous was literally smaller than the olive the garnished the top of the plate. I asked for more sour cream and was told that they'd have to charge me extra for that.

I ordered the pancake breakfast and my sister had the French toast breakfast, we both thought the food was very good quality. I had multigrain pancakes which were very delicious. 

To order your food you have to stand in line outside until you are called to the register to order your food, so essentially as you are waiting outside in line, you should be holding a menu and deciding what it is you would like to order.

Seating was very limited because the bakery is very popular and gets busy so my sister and I sat at the bar area (although they do not sell liquor) which was not bad just very crowded. We were served our meal but it was upon our responsibility to get our own silverware and water- located at the outside seating area of the restaurant.. a little different from what I'm used to. 

At one point, my sister and I were rudely interrupted by a couple of guests who were ordering their meal at the second register; conveniently located literally right in front of my sisters meal... I was very upset during this time because, the register is located right in front of where my sister was sitting and where her food was, the employee was taking many guests orders while my sister was eating; the ordering guests were literally in my sisters lap as they were trying to order their meal.

What I can vouch for on the menu is the generously sized breakfast burrito, which is moist and buttery on the outside so it's more of a knife-and-fork dish if you're so inclined. It's stuffed with eggs, bacon, tomatoes, and is accompanied by a zesty salsa. It may or may not be served with a side of roasted potatoes as the menu would lead you to believe. It certainly evokes French bakery more than taco shop but is pretty tasty nonetheless. The American breakfast, meanwhile, is your standard eggs-and-meat platter with a biscuit. 

Attention to detail isn't necessarily paramount at Jeannine's. Their website contains a heartwarming love story about a lady named Eleanor, yet they named the restaurant ""Jeannine's."" You might find that they've forgotten to bring you a side dish that you ordered, and you'll also want to verify while ordering that the burrito's usual accompaniment, the roasted potatoes, are available, as they might just give you fresh fruit instead. Not that there's anything wrong with fresh fruit, but burritos and berries aren't as natural a duo.

The pluses:
*Yummy scrambled eggs - and they weren't stingy w the cheese when I asked for it!
*Tasty, fluffy biscuit - sometimes non-southerners struggle to make these correctly, but they did it
*Nice to sit outdoors and people watch
*Decently quick table service

The minuses:
*Parking lot is a nightmare - just street park and hoof it
*You will have a wait at the counter before you can order, no matter what time of day. It can be a LONG wait, too, if there's a rush.
*Bathroom was DISGUSTING - think truck stop where all the truckers had food poisoning. And no TP. Eww.
*WAY over-priced - simple food at crazy prices. 
*TINY portions - I got 1 biscuit when I ordered ""biscuits and eggs"". WTH.
*Patrons are kinda weird - one lady randomly accosted my friend and I, asking to sit behind us. We're like umm, we don't work here (obviously, as we're seated at a table)...maybe ask management? At which point she started critiquing my friend's table manners (which are fine, and even if they weren't - WTH?!?)

She waited nearly 20 minutes for her food order and when her order was never called, she went to the counter and was greeted by an attitude stating that IF she hadn't heard anything it was best to check back in 8 (yes eight minutes!)  He said, anything can happen, orders get lost, misplaced, forgotten about and stated, ""it's not NASA back here.""  her order was retaken and when she came to the table to relate the story to me I was dumbfounded!  He's right it's not NASA back there and why would they lose the order? She jokingly asked him ""what are you doing, smoking pot behind the counter?"" She seriously began to wonder why in such a small place would you need to check back in 8 minutes, and what black hole were the orders falling into and why! when I saw the owner David Bozzini walk in I introduced him to my friend Deborah S. Nelson author of Dreams to Reality & can be reached at AuthorYourDreams.com I related the incident to him. He proceeded to tell us that they are a family there and some days you have good ones and some days you have bad ones but they all try to live in love & peace. I was wondering why he didn't want to ""grow"" his employees and seems to be OK with having a ""dysfunctional family"" working there. When he finally stated, ""you eventually got everything you asked for didn't you?"" and I responded that in actuality the sandwich was overtoasted he walked away and apparantly left via the back door! WTF...i see that the attitude comes from the top down and maybe some management courses for the owner might help to adjust the dysfunctional family situation!!!

I'm at the coffee, adding a bit more, when he walks over and starts explaining that large cups like mine have a free refill, but smaller ones don't. I interjected to tell him that I planned on only adding a little bit every time my cup cooled. My point was to let him know that when he saw me up here getting more, i was just getting a little bit. I didn't want him to think I was helping myself to full cups all the time. He never heard this because as soon as I started talking, he stopped and abruptly turned his back on me while sneering, ""Whatever...."" Like a god dammed teenager.

----------
Prior to our hike to Inspiration Point, my friends and I were inspired to come here to grab some breakfast... because nothing says ""We're ready for some strenuous uphill activity"" like stuffing our faces with heavy, sugar-laden carbs. LONG LIVE AMUUUURICA!

I ordered the beloved, infamous Kahlua Banana French Toast, and I wish I could say that sh!t was B-A-N-A-N-A-S, but I was McKayla Maroney-level not impressed (http://imgur.com/H9bWuCf). The food pictures and menu description made this french toast sound heart-stopping heavenly--""authentic challah bread topped with bananas sauteed in Kahlua, brown sugar and butter""--so naturally, I played up my expectations to the tune of other people's praises.

At first, when the food was brought to the table, I was really excited because it looked as amazing in person as it did in pictures. Then after I had finished snapping a million food pictures in true Asian fashion, I opened my eyes and saw that the challah bread pieces, which were already drenched with the caramelized Kahlua sauce, were basically sitting atop a puddle of even more sauce... and then I wasn't so excited anymore. To be honest, I was a little turned off by that abominable discovery.

The first two bites were okay, but each bite after that was a little painful; my throat literally hurt as the sugar glob passed through it (as with all things too sweet). The goopy caramelized Kahlua sauce was so overwhelming that it killed any flavor that the french toast might've had. I tried to eat some of the banana slices in hopes of cutting out some of the sweetness, but that too was covered in sauce... aiyaaah. I ended up finishing only one of the four slices on my plate, of which I'm actually really proud because consuming this dish was a bit more difficult than I had originally imagined. 

In conclusion, it was like as if someone had ejaculated caramel sauce all over every inch of my breakfast, thereby rendering it nearly inedible. I don't really know what I was expecting, but I'm surprised that I didn't let the words ""sautéed in brown sugar and butter"" deter me from ordering the Kahlua Banana French Toast. I guess, no more sweet things for this bitter girl. Ya live and ya learn (even if it's for the hundredth time).

LESSON LEARNED... for now.

// PS. One of my friends ordered the huevos rancheros, and it was AHHHH-MAZING. It comes with corn tortillas, fried egg, beans, cheese, homemade salsa, and avocado. The salsa provided a nice, spicy kick to slap me awake from the oncoming food coma. If I ever make my way back here again, that's what I'm getting!",2014-09-04 21:05:36

I've ordered a latte, (which was pretty much ALL MILK and no coffee), a caramel macchiato (which they forgot to add the caramel to) and a regular iced coffee that was more ice than anything. I've had better luck at McDonald's. 
What's worse than the coffee is the staff. They treat you as if the coffee is free and they are doing you some grand gesture by making you the coffee you overpaid for.

At first it was difficult to tell whether or not it was a ""seat yourself"" or a ""we will seat you"" type of place. You basically order at the cash register and then get a number for your table and a card with the number as well (seemed repetitive).

In this ""line,"" we couldn't find a place where someone wasn't running past (or into) us. It was overwhelming. 

At the register, the cashier was borderline robotic, and didn't mention that the price would increase for things like fruit instead of potatoes. Luckily, my friend noticed that this was an additional $1.50 before I paid. 

The place was clean, the food came out quickly, and my friend's challah French toast was flavorful. 

This is where the good ends again. 
I had ordered the American Breakfast with sausage and a biscuit. Biscuit and eggs were cold. Sausage tasted flavorless. When I say flavorless, I mean that I had the other two people at my table taste it to make sure my tastebuds didn't disappear. They compared it to taking meat without seasoning, and shoving it in meat casing. How do you mess up a sausage? Eggs were also unseasoned. Potatoes tasted like they were boiled - also flavorless.

This was my first time visiting this establishment, We looked online and it said they closed at 3, we arrived at about 1:55pm and where told my the cashier that they closed at 2. We where able to order and sit down to eat, i kept swing them serve people and have people order well after 2:30pm. I got the feeling from the cashier that he didn't want us there. 

Now for the food, I ordered a Pesto Chicken Sandwich, with a side of coleslaw and an Ice Coffee. I will say that the sandwich was DELICIOUS! It was one of the best I've ever had. The ole slaw was not very good, i was expecting a coleslaw with a hint of sweetness, this was was more tart with olives. And as far as the coffee although it was  a very delicious coffee l, i was given a hot cup coffee, not my ice coffee. Im not one to typically drink warm coffee, but i didn't want to tell the staff anything because of how the cashier seemed offset by us being there.

So, i don't have an issue with the food as most of it was delicious, maybe go for the chip option instead of coleslaw. And maybe make sure they get your drink order right. But the service needs some work.  Also, it is very pricey. My total was about $22 for all that food. That i didn't 100% enjoy.",2019-06-22 22:34:39

I thought the omelet was great with the summer herb pesto sauce and micro greens but not for $23. Portions were average and I did feel happy and satisfied after finishing my meal. 

Since it was our first time and there was no hostess in the front when we walked in, we didn't understand the ordering system so we just walked to the counter and ordered. It's confusing.  Apparently, the hostess assigns you a number that you can grab and save a table with but then you wait in line to order at the counter.  The food is brought out to you but we needed refills and no one was waiting on us. I had to go to the counter and ask.  It wasn't until later one worker passing by asked if we wanted more refills.

It is ascetically pleasing with the outdoor seating wrapping around the building and the plants and potters they have scattered around the vicinity. However cute it is did not excuse poor placement of furniture. It had a line out the door and with the little space available from the counter to the door to some of the tables it was a disaster of servers/customers dodging each other. 

Once that was navigated and we successfully queued I ordered the crab omelette (came with a slice of toast cut in two and a cup of fruit), the biscuits and gravy plate with a side of two eggs over medium, a butter croissant, a milk, a coke and a Havana something (espresso? Cappuccino?) It came around to $48.75 plus the 15% tip. Not exorbitant but most definitely not a daily stop for most.

That being said the crab omelette was wonderful. I could easily overeat something like this anytime. Only down side was the piece of shell I crunched down on while I ate. The fruit cup was just right in ripeness and flavor (cantaloupe, honey dew, blueberries, sliced strawberries, pineapple) and none tasted of canned products. My toast was just toast. 

The husband liked his biscuits and gravy but was disappointed at how much the whites ran in his eggs. I know over medium is difficult but still this made it inedible for him.

First off it was a bit overpriced but probably because I was charged an extra 3.60 for substituting for eggs white. Why is the charge so much higher?

Secondly, the cashier couldn't explain the cross contamination protocol for the gluten free items and simply advised me not to get it.(that's comforting for someone with celiac)

The actual gluten free corn bread I got was very bland.
(This bakery should take tips from Savoy, their gluten free items are 1000x better in comparison)

All in all, I received an overpriced value for a half quality experience.

10/10 recommend just going to Denny's across the street if you're in the area. (Well you know unless you just want to feel fancy paying more for mediocrity) Similar quality food and better customer service with a cheaper price.

The only thing that was disappointing was the breakfast burrito. It was a bland and didn't meet up to the expectations for a $14 entree. The side of colorful potatoes were good, but once again bland and lacked something extra.

Java Station is my go-to lunch spot for my favorite sandwich, lox/bagel, and coffee.  Unfortunately, there were no available tables for our small party of two.  All tables were occupied by a mixed cadre of students with laptops open and satchels sprawling.  (I specifically arrived after the lunch hour to avoid the following situation, or so I imagined.)

It had rained earlier,  but wasn't at the time of our visit, so most customers were planted on the inside tables, largely absorbed in work, conversation, and--to the issue here--internet access.  

Java Station is wonderful spot for doing all of these things, but it will need to fine tune customer access to the net with incoming customers' need for food and appropriate seating.  This is a challenge, I know, but a long-term strategy for meeting dining needs is a critical business decision. One solution, adopted by a cafe in Glendora (Classic Coffee), is to tie purchases to internet access for limited periods of time.  Cafe net users will need, in this case, to share physical space with paying customers to ensure that the cafe's business remains viable and vibrant.

Java Station has already adopted a measure in this direction by implementing an ""internet-free"" period during late morning and early afternoon times on Saturday and Sunday.  To some, this decision is inconvenient--I get it, but such internet-free periods also allow food and coffee customers to get what they want and need as well.",2019-12-05 19:34:23

I ordered a sandwich and my friend ordered the American breakfast. Including an iced latte (which came in the worlds smallest cup I was very confused) the meals were not at all satisfying. The sandwich was something I could've made myself, yet it cost about 18 bucks. It was very small and came with a side of chips... was not thrilled. I spoke really highly of this place due to previous experience with breakfast and brunch! The Benedict here and pancakes Were huge portions, like almost too much to eat ive always had leftovers. But my friend was not impressed and couldn't even finish his meal. 

Again, not sure if it was simply the presentation? They came out on paper plates and plastic utensils which again I understand given the current climate, but there was barely any food on the plate and it looked like it took little to no time to prepare at all...Was laughable how little food came out and was all around an odd experience this time around.

All staff did wear gloves and masks, seats were socially distant and again had all paper and plastic that could be immediately tossed after each party",2020-09-05 07:49:32

I enjoy the layout of the establishment; several tables, lounge chairs, couches, a fire place, etc. It provides a cozy atmosphere and most of the staff are great. 

My biggest complaint is that the food selection is minimal at best. There are a few options for breakfast, sandwiches for lunch, however, there are no hearty options for dinner and you will get scolded by Dave, the owner, if you bring outside food. I would be happy to purchase something in the evening if it was fresh and more substantial than a cookie, muffin or the same sandwich I ate for lunch.

I would recommend Coffee Cat on Anacapa and Anapamu if you need to study, having a meeting or relax in a low-maitenance cafe environment during the evening hours. They are open until 10pm on weekdays, offer tasty snacks and allow outside food as well. 

Java Station would get more of my business if they either ramped up their food mood or relaxed their outside food policy. There are simply too many other options in Santa Barbara to settle for less. 

Recommendations if you do find yourself at Java Station, Hibiscus Tea, Chai Tea or Avocado Toast.

I ordered the Chicken Mole Platillo for $15.75 and The Combo #1 (regular torta and a small smoothie) for $14.50 for myself and my friend. During the order I asked if it was OK to use the buy one get one free deal from the Axxess card and they said yes.

So we wait, and when they ring me up the total is over $22. I was confused and asked about the total. This is the point at which he informed me that I have to pay for the smoothie separately ($4.75) as the buy 1 get 1 will only apply to the food.

I was pretty shocked that he waited until the last moment to charge me like this. He clearly wrote just two items on the order, the plate and the combo, it is clearly labeled as a combo item, but he looked at me and said ""well, what do you want to do now?"".

I said I didn't want to pay extra since I told him I was using the buy one get one deal, he wrote down two items, and said nothing about this until now. He said ""It's still a good deal"" but I was so annoyed I explained why I was frustrated. He took the smoothie and put it under the counter and rang me up for $15.75.

I am so surprised that a $4.75 smoothie that almost certainly was going to be thrown away was more important to them than a happy customer who was just trying to use the promotion that they were running. As I left I asked one more time ""Are you really sure I can't just have the smoothie?"" He said no, I can't have it and I walked out feeling pretty stressed about the whole thing.

I could have ordered two tortas or two mole's that cost the same if I knew they were going to do this. I am just so surprised by the greed. I totally understand if he told me this when I was ordering and made it clear I was using the buy one get one deal. No complaints. But to wait until the end, try to get an extra $4.75, then take the smoothie and act like I am being the jerk just blows me away.

I won't ever go back and I'll tell this story every time this place comes up in conversation in town. I hope it was worth the $4.75.

Perhaps my low-star rating is due to the overwhelming ""hype"" that surrounds Alessia Pâtisserie. Truthfully, I had high hopes I would love Alessia's pastries given that the owner is a former Renaud's employee and there seems to be a lot of inspiration drawn from the classic French bakery we all love. 

My latte was perfect and the coffee seemed to have great flavor. To my surprise, when I opened up the boxes I discovered something totally unexpected! These pastries look nothing like what I was expecting. They were intricately designed and creative. In fact, I give props to the artistry that went into creating some thing beautiful and unique. 

Unfortunately the pastries I received for my birthday breakfast simply were not good. They certainly did not live up to the reputation. The one that looks like a little mouse was dry and cakey. The pumpkin pastry had some red stuff inside, too many baking spices, pumpkin flavoring and tasted confectionery. 

Overall lacked precision and focus- other than being pretty and too sweet- they were not at all memorable.

In the end I think the bakery is trying to do too much. Rather than focus on mastering the simple and classic pastries, I see reinventions and ""upgrades"" on things that maybe were better off plain and simple. I do hope to go into the restaurant at some point to update my review on the experience and ambience found at the brick and mortar site. 

As far as presentation goes, I give an A for effort! They are cool and artsy. That being said, some of the other dishes I see posted look to me like they are just too experimental or overdone. When I see the term ""pâtisserie"" I expect classic French pastries- I think Alessia's bakery is cute, but it's not a French Pâtisserie and is still figuring out its own identity-hopefully they'll find it! For now, This would be a place I would go for a brunch with my mom to be ""cutsie""but not necessarily for my every day breakfast or go to bakery.",2021-12-17 05:59:39

We ended up putting down a deposit despite the fact that she was over thirty minutes late for the tasting because the cake was so amazing.

We looked forward to this cake for two years.  But, I'm not sure if it was worth it.  Not because the cake wasn't good but rather because she almost ruined the event for us.

Every time we called her back she said she would call us back...never, ever did.  Finally, we left voicemail messages demanding our deposit back since she was unwilling to work with us.  She replied via email apologizing and saying she would call us the next day in the afternoon but did not.  We finally got her to answer the phone, agreed on a design, and got a signed contract.  Relief - I thought.  The day of the pick up we could not get a hold of her and then when we did she committed to a time and place saying she would call us when she left her home.  We were supposed to meet her at 7:30 but by 7:30 she still had not called us.  We finally got a hold of her at 8:00 and she said she was just leaving.  She also asked us to meet her at a different location and said she would see us in twenty minutes.  We finally saw her 8:40.  

The cake was good but is by no means worth going through that kind of aggravation and stress.  I'm glad my deposit did not go to waste but I will never order another cake through her.  It's a shame too because, like I said, it's the best cake I ever ate.",2010-05-16 19:45:40

nPSsUpH48_ODmGhlQfhkQw,n6mF-SIOULDWqkTEtOcssQ,pGtaxpSxxpmqPs6FAR1W_A,1,0,0,0,"I normally do not bother writing negative reviews of experiences but because the experience pertained to my wedding and I know brides may be researching cake options I cannot sit silent about A Piece of Cake.  I completely respect entrepreneurs who take a risk in starting up their own business but if you do not know how to run an efficient business, you should consider another alternative.  

I chose Terese, the owner of A Piece of Cake, to make the cake for our July 2011 wedding.  When I first reached out to her in March 2011 she responded quickly and was very pleasant.  My husband and I met with her in May 2011 for our cake testing and were pleasantly surprised with her cakes.  We signed a contract and handed her a check for the full amount at that time.  I reached back out to Terese in June to touch base because she had communicated she would send me pictures of cake pedestals we could use.  Our negative experience with Terese began from that point on.  

I contacted her via email and left voicemails for her numerous times and she never responded.  Finally after about 3 weeks of this, my husband became involved and left her a message indicating we wanted our money back unless she responded.  Surprisingly enough she called soon after that voicemail was left and claimed to have sent me an email...I never received an email.  We both had a very bad feeling about the cake situation but we were already in June and our wedding was in July.  At least a month before the wedding I contacted her to ensure she was going to provide a cake box for our cake.  Our cake was simply going to be a two tier token cake used for the cutting of the cake pictures and our intention was to serve it at our brunch the next day.  We had another dessert option for the reception.  She was aware of this and assured us weeks later after sending my email that yes, a cake box would be provided.  I again asked her a few days before the wedding about the cake box and she once again assured me she would provide a cake box.  

Ultimately she did not deliver the cake box.  She later told us she simply forgot to take it out of her car and bring into the reception venue.  Without a proper cake box our caterer opted to put our cake in a Fed Ex box that had contained items shipped for our wedding.  Our caterer failed to tell anyone they had placed the cake in this type of box and the cake was destroyed once placed in the car because no one knew the cake was stored in the Fed Ex box.  Honestly, based on the fact she was so unresponsive I was fully prepared to not have a cake delivered.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was there which is pretty sad.  We contacted Terese after our wedding to discuss what had happened and request some type of refund considering her failure to deliver the cake box resulted in us only taking two bites of our cake.  After some discussion she agreed to give us half of the cost of the cake back but we never heard from her again and never received the check.

Terese may be a good baker and cake decorator but she is not a good business woman.  It is unfortunate she has not learned this over the years after reading some of these reviews.  Please spare yourself any anxiety or worry about your wedding cake and opt for a more established bakery.  If I could do it all over again, I would have paid a little bit more and gone for a brick and mortar bakery that has real business experience.",2012-01-06 03:45:40

Who would have thought that Santa Barbara would have a much, much faster download (and upload) speed compared to the much larger city of LA?  I can tell you that it blew my mind.

Fresco was conveniently located off the 101 and situated in my ideal just-started-on-the-road-and-now-I'm-hungry location.  We pulled off and ordered some food, lunch for me and breakfast for the boy.

My sandwich was just ok.  I had a half caprese: basil, tomato, mozzarella cheese on ciabatta.  The bread was the highlight, as it should have been considering this is a bakery, but the sandwich was not that good.  The basil was concentrated on one side of the sandwich, so for the first part of my sandwich I was wondering if they had forgotten about the basil and the latter portion I had to open up the sandwich and disperse the green specks.  The cheese was stringy but the tomatoes were fresh.

The breakfast burrito was also ordered.  This was supposed to have jalepenos and jack cheese mixed into scrambled eggs and wrapped in a burrito.  I could not taste any of these spicier flavors, just bland eggs wrapped in a bland tortilla.  Salsa came on the side, but this was very mild.

The desserts looked tempting so we ordered a fruit tart, which usually consists of fruit covered in glaze on top of custard in a sweet pastry crust.  They substitute custard for whipped cream here.  The whipped cream was home made, but I'm not a fan of whipped cream and do not enjoy paying 5 dollars for it.

The layout could use more signs.  There are three doors and it is still unclear to me which one you are meant to enter through.  After getting in, you are supposed to walk up to the counter and place your order/pay and then go sit down.  But right next to one of the ""entrance"" doors is what looks like a hostess table and a basket of menu's.  To their credit, there is a tiny light blue sign with yellow writing directing you to place your order.  This sign is unconspicuous.

Other than the physicality of bringing the food to the table, everything here is self service.  They don't even clear your table between the meal and the dessert.  Water is provided both inside and outside (again, self serve).",2009-03-17 07:29:54

I asked for the salad dressing and the feta cheese on the side. No problem. I could avoid the goat cheese.

The salad I had was excellent and fresh. No problem there.

My only beef ( no pun intended ) was the lack of vegan choices and how inattentive the young lady was who took our order. She took out order and printed out receipt. Then we decided we needed a couple oF soft drinks to go with our order and she didn't give us a receipt. After we realized we didn't get our drinks we had to go back and there was another lady who was skeptical about us having already paid for our drinks.

Just this basic lack of customer service and lack of vegan-friendly choices was enough to take away 2 stars.

They offered no solution other to say that they ""have it here"". I said, ""I guess I'll come get it then"" (20 minutes round trip). When I arrived they handed it to me and said they were sorry - I felt the container and said I was concerned it was not hot anymore. The staffer said ""it should be"" to which I replied, ""but it's not, it's lukewarm"". I am not sure why one would think that soup in a styrofoam container that had been sitting on the shelf for a half hour would still be hot. The same staffer offered to get me a new soup if I wanted, which I did not because I would have to wait again for the order - I had already wasted to much time with Fresco. Instead, I came home, where everyone else was done eating their food from Fresco, and microwaved my soup.

The salad was delicious and I can see why people order it. I would have it again when in the mood for a salad. The quiche was my favorite item that we ordered. The pizza was a little disappointing because the prosciutto and apple were sliced too big and it was a little greasy.

Yelp reviews are deceiving.... 

No one greeted or welcomed us upon walking in. The bakery/cashier side of the cafe was hot and had a number of flies buzzing in it. 

The restaurant side with dining tables and chairs was cooler but not very clean. I assume that management or the owner of the place cuts corners by not hiring waiters or a cleaning staff as a lot of the tables were dirty and I had to ask the chef for napkins.

The food itself left a lot of be desired. The sandwiches didn't taste fresh. The bacon in the triple decker (which had nothing triple about it) was more like jerky. I thought that a $14 sandwich would be delicious! It was not, I have to say that Subway is a better deal and a third of the price for twice the sandwich. 

Two sandwiches cost $30 with no drink and a almost mandatory tip of 20%. You are to tip in the jars that are found throughout the cafe or before you get your food. The payment and gratuity system seems a little entitled, considering the lack of good food and service.

PzqPZoltWwpTbuhPdxdphw,aEeu_6fzFiXY3tWcKa3rJg,pGtaxpSxxpmqPs6FAR1W_A,1,1,0,0,"A Piece of Cake is not a legitimate business. Teresa makes her cakes from her home which smells of odorous dog and mold. Her home/kitchen is unsanitary and is not rated by any government agency. She prepares her cakes and other ""treats"" last minute, in a filthy kitchen while her three dogs play nearby. 

Has anyone ever wondered why you can't get a tasting appointment at her store or in a kitchen? It's because there isn't one. She claims to rent space in a kitchen, however, I suspect this is a lie. I had the misfortune of knowing Teresa for a few months. She would often bore me with tales of unsatisfied customers and I can tell you most, if not all of the poor reviews you've read are worse than the reviewer knows and could describe. Apart from her ruining, or coming close to ruining several events, she doesn't give refunds - rather, she might give you credit so you can purchase some more tainted confections and ruin another event of yours.

Teresa is not a professional cake baker, nor is she any sort of a businesswoman. Some of her cakes do appear aesthetically pleasing and may even taste good, however, if you knew what you were getting yourself into when you ordered a cake, you might rethink your decision. I doubt she keeps any sort of records or invoices and if you knew her current state of affairs, it would send up a red flag telling you how well, or not, she runs her cake baking operation. 

I'm not sure what she charges but if you can put a price on not getting sick by eating her cake or knowing that your wedding cake doesn't has dog hair in it, then it probably wouldn't be worth it for you to buy a cake from ""A Piece of Crap"" - sorry *cake.",2013-06-05 17:10:53

I met her at a bridal expo in Santa Barbara and from the look of her booth and the taste of her samples I made an appointment for her to meet with my fiance and I to sample wedding cakes.  Theresa showed up 30 minutes late but her cake was amazing and her portfolio was beautiful so we paid in full that day.  BIGGEST mistake I made in my wedding plans.  
I attempted to contact her two months before the wedding (6 months after our payment was made in full), I got a hold of her after one week and 3 attempts. I was disappointed with her demeanor towards me, as if my one and only check-in was a great inconvenience to her.  But I let it go, it's about the cake right?
Three days before my wedding i contacted her to get a delivery time and to inquire about a gluten free dessert for a guest who had newly been diagnosed with Celiacs.  Again, it took her a few days to get back to me, and we agreed on a gluten free dessert and an arrival time of 11:30 for my 12:30 brunch reception.  I thought this was cutting it close, but I understood that butter cream cannot sit out for hours and hours.  
My wedding was amazing and everything was running perfectly on time (unusual for wedding).  About 1:30 I looked over at my cake table only to see a completely empty table.  No Cake, no gluten free dessert.  I'll say it again.  THIS WOMAN DID NOT DELIVER MY WEDDING CAKE TO MY WEDDING UNTIL 20 MINUTES BEFORE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO CUT IT.   
I'm still sick about it.  How can you be in this business and have such little professionalism?  She gave my wedding coordinator some song and dance about how a cake she delivered earlier had been  knocked over by a waiter so she had to make them a new one.  I believe this was a lie.  After reading the other reviews that have been left for her I think she is just one of those people incapable of arriving on time.  And others will pay the price.  Other brides will spend their weddings fretting over what kind of dessert they will serve their guests, and how much they will have to take out of their honeymoon fund to pay the photographer to stay later.  More people will look at their wedding pictures and see an empty table in the background.  The entire point of getting my grandparents 61 year old cake topper was so that we could enjoy having a piece of them at our wedding for longer than 20 minutes.  That's what makes me the angriest. 
It's a complete shame because she is such and amazing baker with great vision and delicious cakes, but she lets people down on one of the most important day of their lives.  A shame.",2011-10-12 17:15:50

None of the staff, including the manager, seemed concerned about my daughter's reaction and nobody came over to our table to see if she was okay.  Nor did anybody offer to comp the meal or any part of it.  It wasn't until we asked for a refund on the uneaten meal that they complied, reluctantly.  We definitely will not be returning to this restaurant and advise anyone with food allergies to avoid it, as well.

TbdY07nSy5D7AEs7e8o6NQ,bl5KUE6Fnwuhcvopd4Zf8w,1kVnChI4aqsPw9i2PVqkkw,1,1,1,0,"At the Fresco Café, I always felt there was a ""Home Cooked Component"" added to every meal ... I've hosted Sisters from my Bible Study at the Fresco Café and on notable occasions Work-Colleagues, Family Members and Friends... Like I said - the Fresco Café was my ""GO TO SPOT"" - ""My Happy Place"" ... But my Culinary-Romance abruptly ends today!

Keep in mind - my loyalty to  the Fresco Café was not without the need to forgive the occasional ""OOPS"" on a ""TO-GO Order"" gone wrong or from time-to-time the ""Soup Of The Day"" or a side dish being ... well let's just say, not so good and leave it at that. Over the course of five years of my patronage, I dismissed ""Rude Service"" to someone just having a bad day... I was always willing to give the Server a pass, in addition to leaving a sizable tip.

All through the Covid Pandemic, I strongly believed in patronizing this local business. I often traveled from Goleta to the Fresco Café 3987 B / State Street / Santa Barbara - sometimes two or three times a week... Spending no less than $25 to $40 for a single lunch or dinner to-go.

Today's Horrible Lunchtime Experience at the Fresco Café: I had just finished ordering a $20.00 meal - plus pastry - totaling $35.00... after seating myself...I was then approached by a Server who embarrassed me by loudly & very rudely asking if I had paid for the ""half-cup of watered-down lemonade"" sitting on my table... Then the Server proceeded to thrust my paid bill in my face, in-front of the other patrons - who knew me as a regular.

I confess to All ... Yes, I am guilty of taking a half-a-cup of lemonade, rather than water, because I needed to swallow some very large pills ... That was my crime and maybe some may think I got what I deserve... You may be right... 

But the extent to which they handled the situation was not justified. I truly don't believe, in all honesty, that making a customer feel like a criminal, a thief and sabotaging any further business was worth all that effort.

At that point - I asked to speak to the Manager-On-Duty, Bobby Lopez ... the rude-Server returns to my table to report that the Manager expects me to pay for that cup of lemonade upon my next visit. I went to the Manager-On-Duty and asked for my money back... which he promptly did, but not before saying and I quote, ""You take a cup of Lemonade upon every visit"" ... That was a bold, face lie - as I have been taking almost all my meals to-go for the past year ...due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.

I now realize that Customer Service, my being viewed as a valued Customer or my long-time support & patronage of the Fresco Café - as reflected by the Manager-On-Duty's attitude & his training of Staff, is not a priority to this establishment and that the Fresco Café must really be in need of the monies raised from my ""one watered-down cup of Lemonade"".

Final Note: I remember fondly stumbling upon the Fresco Café, a landmark restaurant in Santa Barbara since 1995. Mark Brouillard, the Owner, once took the time to introduced himself - on my very first visit ... I had fallen in love with that little eclectic café ... I'm so sorry that the environment and atmosphere has become so toxic ... I hope & pray that Mark Brouillard is made aware of the loss of a once truly dedicated patron.",2021-08-31 07:44:21

But I feel like things are very unfortunately heading downhill. The food is no where near as good as it used to be. And today's experience was bad enough to likely end my usual several times per week visits. 

I ordered a meal to go, and was told they would call my name when it was ready. Normally they are pretty fast. Today I sat there waiting for almost a half hour, before I finally went up to the take out door to inquire. There was my food sitting there in a bag. It had obviously been sitting there for some time. Yet no one ever called my name. Cold salad sitting on top of warm entree means that the salad was as lukewarm as the entree that had just been sitting there for quite a while. 

But what really prompted me to write a review was that I had also purchased a cookie. And I had specifically asked if they had any chocolate chip cookies that had NO nuts in them. Yet when I got home, I found out that the cookie they had given me had nuts in it. This is at least the fourth time this has happened to me at this restaurant. So today I called to complain about it. 

The first person I talked to ""accidentally"" hung up on me. (I am pretty sure he was the one who served me the wrong cookie. I recognized his voice.) So I called back and asked to talk to the manager. The manager was kind of rude and dismissive. 

When I asked about why the cookies aren't labeled as ""with nuts"" or ""without nuts"", mentioning the HUGE liability issue for the many people who are allergic to nuts, he just said, ""Ok, I will have them label them."" 

When I told him that I had to throw my cookie in the garbage, he merely said, ""Sorry about that."" He didn't sound sorry, or even the least bit friendly. He sounded like he had better things to do. He made no offer to replace the cookie that I paid for and had to throw away. 

That by itself speaks volumes to me, and I am now thinking that management may be the explanation about why this place is now sadly going downhill.",2020-10-28 00:26:49

Staff is friendly and service is good.  HOWEVER, except for the wild salmon, the fish entrees are almost always overcooked.  How they can get the salmon right, but overcook everything else, is baffling.  Last night's halibut was only marginally edible.  Even when I ask when ordering to caution the kitchen about this, it's always a crap shoot.

Also, simple requests, such as ""no bread"" or ""toss the salad"", are executed only on a hit-or-miss basis.  Once in the bag (or in better times, on the table), unwanted bread must be discarded.  And, if the dressing is not tossed in, I end up with useless plastic too small to be recycled.  This really pisses me off. 

Because I exclusively order take-out, I can't send the overdone fish back.

Even if they are working on other orders, most quality places will acknowledge customers as their walk in and apologize for the wait. Second of all, when the waitress finally acknowledged us she spoke so softly, we couldn't hear her. We had to have her repeat everything she said. She seemed very awkward and uncomfortable when we asked her to speak a little louder because of the noise. If the bakery is too loud, it should have been the initiative of the waitress to speak up and communicate clearly. It was frustration placing an order because the waitress was difficult. Lastly, it did not seem like they were putting in any effort to getting orders out quickly. They worked at such a leisurely pace. When I came to the counter to ask for a cup for water (along with other customers waiting for water cups too), it seemed like they were purposely ignoring me and the other guest. They avoided eye contact and worked slowly. I had to interrupt the barista in order for her to acknowledge me. It is really unfortunate that they don't have better customer service.

Well you serve it on a Brioche, the sweet and salty flavors just don't mix well. My mistake (they also offer one other type of regular bread), so it's on me.

The cake tasted good, but left a greasy feeling aftertaste which I am going to attribute to whatever they bake it with.

However, we ""tried"" to order lunch first. This was around 130-2 o'clock only to find out they had run out of bread. They are open until 7pm so I don't know what they were serving since all they offer are sandwiches and one type of soup. 

So after finding out they had no bread the woman helping us asked if we would like a brioche roll since they had no more sandwich bread. So when our 1 order of cup of soup and half a sandwich came there was no brioche ""roll"" there was only a vague resemblance to a half risen muffin. We asked  the woman where the roll was and she told us rudely that the so called half risen muffin was in fact a roll. This meal (really a snack because of such a small amount of food) was a grand total of $18.00. 

We asked for our money back because it was not a half a sandwich and we were not going to pay $18 for a cup of soup and a couple slices of ham. The woman never said anything at all to make this situation better. She could have at least given us the other half risen muffin so you could call what we had a sandwich. As for the dessert we couldn't even try anything since we were unable to get a decent meal. Usually customers return if you are at least pleasant.

She suggested putting it on a different plate, and brought me back the soggy toast and fruits with the same omelette now on a new less liquid filled plate, but still liquid nonetheless. I told her I wanted to order something else since her suggestion didn't really solve the problem. Just egg whites scrambled would do. She said that was ok.

The cake here was quite dense, lacking the flakiness or elasticity you'd expect from similar offerings, but not surprising for a gluten-free approach. 

Too often in America poor pastry skills are quickly dressed over with too much sugar in the cake or on it (icing and more icing...blech).  In the cakes sampled here I would say that it's hard to overcome the lack of gluten(which isn't to say I haven't had fantastic and stunning gluten free cakes) and the sugar inside maybe was a bit on the ""too much"" side to compensate? The icing although keeping to the American tradition of covering the cake was not overdone, thankfully.

This buzzy bakery is situated right in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara and has a very inviting classical elegance. The decor is minimalist yet warm and inviting with gleaming white-washed walls, black leather tufted benches, marble-topped tables and French rattan bistro chairs. 

The desserts are very eye-poppingly beautiful and crafted with care and precision. Don't be shy to marvel at the generous display cases filled with gorgeous cakes and assorted desserts. I'd give Lilac five stars for presentation.  

We ordered 3 different desserts. My Oreo Cheesecake ($8) was very nicely presented and satisfying (curbed my sweet tooth) but it was missing that wow-factor. Normally I consume cheesecakes in record time and, after those first initial bites, I still was seeking that elusive creamy, dreamy wow-factor. My mom said her Chocolate Almond Praline ($8) was good and she enjoyed it but she wouldn't need to come back for it. My brother didn't like his Sour Cream Coffee Cake ($5.50). The cake was lacking in flavor and kind of dry. 

Great place for those seeking decadent gluten alternatives in Santa Barbara.

From floor to ceiling, from the storefront to the back patio, everything looks perfectly charming and bright. But the service was disorganized and imbalanced. There was one girl who was assembling orders, packaging them, running to the back to refill water for the patio people, pouring drinks into cups, and then running to the front to help seated customers. She was understandably not happy. Meanwhile, her other coworkers, who are perfectly capable guys, were just leisurely standing around or taking their sweet time taking orders. When it was my turn the cashier guy was barely listening. So of course, he gave incomplete and incorrect info to the same frazzled girl who inevitably got my order wrong. So I had to repeat myself by checking against the e-receipt from my cellphone because I guess she couldn't ask her coworker to get it straight and help her out. I had a large order of cupcakes, cookies, and other pastries---all unreasonably overpriced btw. What was most disappointing of all was that none of the items tasted up to par. Not a single one.

Ready for more?

I had also ordered a hot chocolate as my secondary measuring stick for any bakery that offers it (primary gauge is for the baked goods, of course). If they can properly make a cup of ""chocolat chaud"", then I can trust that the rest of their ingredients and methods will be high quality. I know you may think it's an unfair expectation, but if the bakery is confident enough to offer it (in french no less), then gosh darn it, it better be right. 

Verdict: Fail. What I received was hot water with a hint of chocolate. I couldn't even finish it because who drinks water with lightly sprinkled chocolate powder, let alone pay a pretty penny for it? A packet of Swiss Miss instant hot chocolate with just water, not even milk, would have been more satisfying.

My issue is with the staff. I waited almost 20 minutes to order my food and then another 30min to get my food. The bakery was packed so I understood there would be a wait time. But for some already prepared quiches and cakes, this is unacceptable. They had so many employees yet half of them were putting stickers on empty boxes that they then put into cupboards to be used another time, instead of helping customers. It was really odd. And the cashier was new (in training) which is fine except probably not the best idea to do in the mist of the holiday when the line is almost to the door. The staff is also very unfriendly and don't seem too happy about working there. I think if the owner can figure out how to match her staff with her delicious food, this place will stick around for a long time.

I have a gluten allergy and have been eating, almost exclusively, here for years. We order cakes for occasions and buy bread by the loaf. I take my out-of-town guests without gluten issues here. I'm not sure what happened to Lilac recently, though. 

While I am very aware that restaurants are facing challenges this year, Lilac chose not to open for quite awhile after the shutdown, despite the fact that the majority of their menu is soups, salad, and sandwiches. 

When they did reopen, with very short hours, the price of the quiche that I ordered in January went from $35 to $75, and many other items jumped in price drastically, as well. As a loyal customer, that felt more like a slap in the face than it felt like they appreciated my patronage. 

Today, I finally agreed to go eat at Lilac and give it another try. They have a fraction of the baked goods that they used to have. My partner was in line, second to a party of four. I went to sit at the only available table outside, which was a two-top. 

A man who worked there approached and told me that the table was reserved. There was no reserved sign. I asked what he meant. He said it was reserved for people ordering indoors. My partner was the next in line, ordering indoors for both of us. I told him that, and he asked me to leave the table anyway. There were no other parties of two ahead of us. 

Had I brought my parents with me, as I often do, my dad would not have been able to go into the restaurant to order and would've had to sit and wait at a table, as he is disabled. Would he be asked to leave, as well? I can't take that chance. 

There was no sign indicating that all guests needed to stand until they ordered. Had I seen one, I wouldn't have asked my partner to wait in line in the first place. I'm not willing to spend the upwards of $50 per person that I'd planned and then gamble as to whether there will be an available table. Nor am I willing to support a business that treats its guests for Sunday brunch with no hospitality or, frankly, respect.

I stopped my partner from ordering and do not plan to return.

Intrigued by all the pastries in their display and being a fairly accomplished baker myself, I was anxious to try it out. We got a table outside and a waitress brought a tray of weary-looking desserts to choose from that didn't look very appetizing at all, obviously having made the rounds over some time! I told her we wanted to check out the other sweets in the display case and she said to be sure to make note of what we wanted & tell her because it was only table service (note this statement comes into play later on...) So we browsed the display case and asked some specific questions of the various sweets of a pleasant young man there. He had his rehearsed descriptions down pat, but wasn't able to answer specifics; for ex, the he told us the eclair was filled with whipped cream between 2 cookies...hmmm, I asked, it doesn't look like a pâte à choux dough that I would expect with eclairs and is it really just filled with whipped cream? He had no idea what I was talking about. In the end we ordered a Sarah Bernhardt cookie and a piece of a strawberry cake. Neither was particularly good and certainly not special - the cake was mostly whipped cream and the Sarah Bernhardt was a very thin cookie piled with a so-so hazelnut mousse & dipped in chocolate. 

The shock came when we received the bill - the cake slice was $9.95 and my cookie was $7.95!! Note that while a few of the cookies have prices displayed inside, most of what's in their cases does not have a price marked. And now I understood why the waitress was so concerned that we not choose & pay inside, and then take our desserts to a table!! Now had those desserts been exceptional, I would have been fine with it. The young man who helped us inside actually came to the table to take our payment and when I expressed surprise at the prices, his response was, ""The reason we've been able to stay afloat is that we keep our dessert prices very high and we use all organic ingredients"" Really??! Trust me, if they really used all organic ingredients, that fact would be displayed in writing everywhere and of course, it isn't.  He then said, ""well, I'm sure it was very delicious and worth it."" Uh no, they were pretty disappointing and definitely not worth it. Also, my weak coffee was lukewarm:( Total bill for these 2 desserts, cappuccino, coffee and tip was $32! 

So bottom line is, we won't be back because while it's a nice enough looking place on State Street, the taste/quality doesn't warrant the high prices they charge. There are so many other wonderful places to choose from that Andersons really needs to up their game and/or get their prices in line...

This was to remain a fantasy, because what we got was anything but light and fluffy. It was a dense, saccharin and artificial tasting bomb of a cake slice, drenched in a sugary substance, the crystalline globules we could see sticking to the cake, no microscope needed, the naked eye even with my near-sightedness, I could detect. It was for shame this sorry excuse for a princess cake, not only was the actual sponge cake part weirdly and horribly sugar filled, the marzipan part was sticky and tore apart in the strangest way I've ever seen. I so wanted to love this bakery, because I'm partial to Danish . . . love Solvang . . . but this was hands down the absolute worst cake I've had in my life. Maybe their lunches and breakfasts are better, and maybe their other pastries or cakes are good, but this princess cake--beware. Btw, the service was also not great: we were seated at one of their patio tables at around 3:pm and 12 minutes later, still nobody to take our order. We got up and placed the cake order to go, asked for two forks and napkin. Dug into the cake on the sidewalk, and with one bite looked at each other with dismay.

Even their slogan (""You'll never forget your first crush.""), invokes feelings of happiness and nostalgia.  I've been here twice, and both times left me disappointed that this was not going to be the dreamy hotspot I would now be spending all my time frequenting.  Shoot!  

The first time I went there I was excitedly drawn to the café for all of the charm, and sweetness (pun intended) that it has to offer.   I soon realized, however that the staff there seems to lack knowledge or passion for food.  When I ordered and asked for my eggs to be cooked medium/medium-well the waitress seemed confused, until I finally had tell her that I didn't want the eggs to be ""runny.""  Now, I don't want to sound like a food snob (but perhaps I already do!), however my feeling is that if you have eggs on the menu, you should be prepared to take orders for eggs done ""easy,"" ""medium,"" and ""well-done"" and know what each of those kinds of egg mean.

The egg ""incident"" really wasn't that big of a deal on its own, but rather a minor annoyance that only intensified during my second visit.  The second time I went to Crushcakes, I ordered the ""Tree-hugger"" -a delicious roasted veggie and goat cheese sandwich with a side salad.  My friend ordered the ""Kiss My Grass"" -a kind of cold veggie sandwich with a side salad.  

The sandwiches were delicious and healthy, and the salads seemed like they could have been good as well (the pumpkin seeds in the salad were incredible!), however we happened upon a very unfortunate series of ""salad incidents"" that left my friend and I feeling really frustrated with Crushcakes and ultimately deciding write this review/never come back.

When I got my salad I discovered two rather large chunks of rotten lettuce in it.  When I went back to tell the cashier that I would like a new salad, she was rather unsympathetic to my salad situation, but went back to ask the food preparers for a new salad.  The food preparers were in sight and in earshot of me, and had an annoyed response and tone to my request (not really reassuring or supportive!). 

As I was waiting for my new salad, my friend discovered a piece of plastic (!) in her salad.  As my friend walked up to the cashier with her salad in hand, ready to request a new salad, the cashier interrupted her before she could even speak and said, ""A new salad is just going to look the same!""  The lack of support and understanding for our faulty salads was incredible and inexcusable!  

Finally, with two new salads we finished our meal, but not before I discovered a piece of paper towel in my new salad (oh the terrible salad luck!) that made me give up.  Overall, it wasn't necessarily the lack of salad quality control that made us frustrated and upset with Crushcakes, but rather the lack of passion, compassion, and support that the staff exuded.  It seems like the staff is simply a bunch of high school or college students who are working there for the sake of a summer job and socializing, not because of their passion for wholesome food and a welcoming atmosphere.  

On a final note, the cupcakes were just okay.  The frosting was too sweet, and there was sadly a fly flying around in the cupcake case, and landing on the cupcakes.  Sigh...  I had high hopes for this place...",2011-08-26 11:45:30

It was flaky, full of almond flavor and the sugar sprinkle on top gave it a sweet crunch.

While in line, I was given a sample of their bite size cheesecake, which was also delicious!

The only reason why I'm not giving this bakery five stars is due to their bad attitude.  While I was looking at the choices, a man came in for a slice of cake.  When he asked if the cake was just sliced or if it had been sitting around for a while, the blond woman helping him (she had spoken what I assume was Danish to a previous customer) became extremely annoyed.  As the man left with his companion, she watched them leave and then said ""stupid people"" to another worker as another customer and I are standing right in front of them.  Trust me, I heard her clearly and so did the other customer because we looked at each other in disbelief.  So, if you go, make sure you don't ask any ""stupid"" questions or rest assured, that's what you'll be called on your way out.

The main reason being PORTION SIZE. We ordered the raw veggie wrap ($10) and the cauliflower crust sandwich ($11) and were nowhere near full after eating. We were also bummed to realize that all our dishes appeared to have significantly less ingredients in them compared to other photos on yelp. I understand that organic, quality ingredients cost more, but there's definitely a point where it just feels like a rip-off, and that is what we experienced today. It's a great concept and it seems like their strongest asset may be their drink selection, but there's improvements that should definitely be made if they want to grow.

The tea cups were nothing more than plain white coffee cups. The tea itself was bagged tazo tea that I could get from any grocery store. And they had very few options. The spread, however, was pretty large. There were only two types of sandwiches, open faced, so it was actually toast. Still, it was decked out toast and the bread was quite tasty, as were the scones. Points for that. We were presented with their homemade orange marmalade and strawberry jam, neither were sweet enough for my liking. I would have preferred clotted cream to their hand-whipped cream, but the scone was perfectly delicious without the extras. The fruit cup looked delicious but alas, all of it was tainted sour by the pineapple. We were way too stuffed to touch the two full sized eclairs, apple strudels, and petit fours. 

While we appreciated that the meal was filling and that they did not skimp on anything, if you're going to offer high tea, you'll need to change a few things. First, get some cute tea pots and cups.

The service was mostly ok except for the waitress putting down a filled a coffee cup down so hard it silenced the room.  Actually, my husband sent back his first coffee as it was luke-warm and rather tasteless.  He ordered a latte and that was fine.

Our big issue was the tasteless ice cream sundae's and bland triple chocolate layered cake.  For our 9 year old, we orderded a ""child sized"" sundae and received an adult sized sundae that had thick bland, hardened chocolate sauce.  She could eat the chocolate as it was as hard as metal, so she removed it from the ice cream (it looked so weird, like chocolate dentures-disgusting).  The ice cream wasn't anything to write home about.  The worst was the cake.  For something ""with"" chocolate, it was bland except for an awful liquor taste or flavoring.  I took one bite and left it.

In the end, the waitress gave our bill  ($50+) with the bland, returned coffee added on.  We had to get the manager to correct it.

I think just for espresso's, it's ok but the desserts are so old, if not crusty (in presentation-everything had strawberries dotted on top) very old school.  Certainly, not worth going again for us.

Staff did nothing to make it special.  Placed at a table of eight right near the bakery case and front entrance while tables on the other side were available.  Never got the same waiter twice.  When I asked about child meal for my granddaughter the waiter said ""this is not a child friendly restaurant"".  The owner/manager picked up a basket of a few pieces of bread from a table not far from us that had left and asked us if we wanted more bread.  Unbelievable.  No one had been to our table with anything prior to that so that was the first thing anyone brought.  We had to flag down a waiter to take our order and to take our money.  We all chipped in considerably for the tip - which decreased in amount over the time we were made to wait and discuss our disgust with service.

Food - Okay.  The High Tea is not a traditional High Tea at all and misses the mark entirely.  Would not recommend it if you have ever experienced a true High Tea this will be disappointing.  Also, they do not put tea cozies on the teapots and the tea does not stay warm.  The table was so crowded because no one would clear away the service as it was used.  They were not accommodating at all when we just wanted a little room on the table for the birthday cards/gifts.  I have not seen wait staff this neglectful in a very long time.  

We witnessed the owner/manager raising her voice at one of the waitstaff.  It it was meant to improve service we didn't benefit from it.  There are too many other places to dine in SB that provide customer service and care about their customers.

It's not your typical looking scone, but it definitely tastes DELISH.  My boyfriend ordered the cinnamon danish, which was just meh.  It's hard to screw up a cinnamon danish so I didn't consider it anything special.  

As far as breakfast, I was not impressed.  I ordered the salmon eggs benedict and substituted the salmon for deli ham instead.  It came on a baguette that was prepared like French toast (dipped in egg, had a lot of sugar in it).  The baguette wasn't even toasted, so it was really hard to cut through.  I also thought the benedict was really weird tasting with the sweet and salty thing going on and didn't enjoy it too much unfortunately.  I asked for the eggs ""medium"" but they were prepared more on the easy side, with some of the white runny.  Based on other negative reviews, it doesn't seem like this place really has the whole egg/breakfast thing down.  Also, the benedict does NOT come with breakfast potatoes (uh, RIP OFF) but don't bother ordering a side order of them, because it's so not worth it.  Their ""roasted"" potatoes are greasy and cut in big chunks, making the taste extremely bland.

At one point we really were trying to decide whether to head back to LA and grab stuff there or stay and find a place there.  I got hooked on a couple of specials I saw outside - duck for me, pork tenderloin for the gf.  So we decided, sure why not?

When I asked about the special outside, they mentioned that those were lunch specials and presented us with their dinner specials instead.  Uh oh.  Rather than be rude and pack up and go, I sat there like an idiot and proceeded to order.

We started with their smoked salmon appetizer.  It was unlike any smoked salmon I've ever had.  It was a regular filet of salmon cooked with no discernible smoke flavor.  It was layered in a sauce with sliced zucchini.  I dislike cooked salmon.  Disliked this one more for the overcooking done to it.  I also had a small cup of their potato leek soup and the gf had the chicken vegetable, neither were anything special.

I got the gf a ribeye (medium rare) which came out well (as in doneness, not as in cooked nicely).  Also, have to say that this ribeye lacked any of the marbling you'd usually find with a good ribeye.  Regardless, it wasn't good.

I ordered the Scandinavian duck and I apparently didn't read it well enough b/c I thought it was duck breast, but it turned out to be leg.  Since I thought I was getting some breast action, I asked the waiter for it to be served medium rare.  No indication from the waiter that it would be a problem.  I get it and it is so friggin' overcooked.  Yuk.  

So, we complete our completely dissatisfying meal.  I don't know why I didn't bother complaining, cuz I really should have.  So the waiter takes our plates away and then just disappears.

I have frequented this place many times and have literally referred it hundreds of times. Being a former bakery owner in this town I have sent clients over that were interested in marzipan based cakes amongst other items. This morning I came for breakfast (I just retired a few weeks ago ) and thought I would go for breakfast before my shopping spree  on State street. 
There were two waiters who helped who were quite competent but then there was a surfer looking type who was USELESS .
I asked if I could some Kringle instead of the scone they brought out he said no even though there was lots of it in the display case. I went back inside and asked the 'good waiter' if I could have a slice and would be willing to pay extra. He said absolutely and brought it out no problem!
My waiter never came to the table once to ask how my meal was. 
Upon sitting there I noticed a magazine just propped up on a stand. It was a particular issue that Anderson's and I (Montecito Confections) had been in the same issue. I unfortunately had lost my copy and was so excited to see it again. I asked the useless waiter if I could just take a quick look and take a picture. He said ""no!
So I asked please could you ask the owner as this was important and sentimental to me. He came back with another no!
I couldn't believe it especially after I told him who I was and that she knows how much business I have referred! 
I went inside the bakery myself to ask Mrs Anderson herself . She was SO rude to me I couldn't even believe it! Yes they were busy , but that does not excuse her disgusting attitude to a paying customer. Never in a million years would I treat a customer that way!

Before they changed their name to Green Table, their food used to be very top notch until towards the end of the ""Boochies"" run where their food started to taste way too salty, but their customer service was top notch and very friendly!

When they changed to Green Table, their food changed back to being just as great as I had remembered, but their customer service with their staff has been immensely poor. 

Every time I come here (and I've brought friends after raving about this place for months) they have constantly forgotten about some of the food I've ordered and payed for and have caused me to wait for my group to finish eating before I am aware that they have completely forgotten about what I had paid for.

I frequent quite a lot of organic, healthy, pure, veg/ vegan restaurants around LA and wherever I travel. While this has a great thing going for it, I'm really not sure what all the 5 star reviews are for. I went and had a ceremonial matcha latte. I think the fact they offer sprouted almond milk is great, although I wish they had more alternative milk choices (hemp, coconut guys.. these are standard for vegan joints.. not everyone likes almonds, they consume a ton of water and some people are intolerant to nuts). THE PORTIONS need to also be larger. I also ordered an orange smoothie and it was too much money for the size I got. The matcha was made perfectly. I order matchas most places I go and it's rarely made this well- no chunks, nicely frothed a little, slightly sweetened. It was a good matcha and that portion was pretty good. The guy mentioned below made it.

The customer service: the guy with dreads or braids was really sweet and helped patiently answer all my questions since all ingredients weren't listed on the board (I'm thinking of the flavored chais and maybe a couple other things) and it was my first time in. The menu was extremely small and limited and most items contained things I don't eat. There were a couple items that looked really promising but they were out (and it was like 10am). So all in all it was kind of a bust for me.. not sure I'll return. There was another girl with tattoos and she was cold to me, seemed like I was unwelcome there.

Gave it another try and the same thing. The girl who rang me up (same girl again) was slightly less chilly but acted so annoyed that I was even there it looked painful for her to act polite.

I also got the french onion soup as part of my combo. I'm not in the habit of ordering french onion, but I don't like tomato and wasn't feeling chili that day. I'm pretty sure most French onion soups come with some sort of bread and cheese on top. This one was just broth and onions. pretty salty and again, not very hot. 

I felt badly coming in so soon before closing, but I was starving and I was still out before the place officially closed so I feel like my meal should've been better or at least more filling. I had to go next door and order a cupcake to finish off so I didn't leave hungry. Maybe that's their ploy, after all, business for both sides!

I've read good things about it, checked their menu on line and I love French food.

Renaud's in the uptown area is inside the Loreto Plaza Shopping center, in the corner,close to Gelson's. Free parking.

The place is cute, cozy, has inside and outside seating. We stopped by around 2 pm and the pastry selection was poor. No savory ones, whatsoever. Also, they don't label or price anything so you have to keep asking the snooty guy behind the counter what every pastry has inside. I also asked a waitress for a menu, she made me go to the counter and there were none there. Let's put it that way, the service in this place is very poor, everyone has an attitude and they are very unhelpful. Prices are high and the selection is poor, there aren't many things on the menu either.

We ended up getting 2 apricot danish pastries which were small and generic, we had way better in other places. The cafe mocha I got was big, decent, but it took forever for them to make it and bring it to the table.

Which is odd because over the years, I felt like that was one of the consistently good things about this place, even when our food orders were mediocre, sometimes. 

An example of the problem I had on a recent visit: I placed my order and the restaurant was fairly quiet with everyone else already eating and enjoying their pastries and coffees. There were about ten people who came in after me, but well after I grabbed some water and sat down. 25 minutes later, after all those after me had been served and I had asked two waiters to check on my order, I still didn't even have my coffee. After another few minutes went by, I just directly approached the barista, who was actually very sweet and apologetic and stopped what she was doing to make my coffee. Great! Now I had something to sip on while I waited even longer for my food.  

Finally, after asking a third waiter, someone from the kitchen came out to ask what my order was. Clearly, it had been completely missed from the front of the house to the kitchen. Not sure how or why, but I had to repeat my order twice and even then someone came back out, confused about what I wanted as my side. 

By this time, at least 40 minutes had passed. You know it's a long wait when you're now sitting with an entirely new group of people than when you came in and they're getting ready to finish up!

I was just about to walk out when they brought my food, which was kind of cold. Not sure how that happened. There was an apology, but no attempt to explain what happened and certainly no attempt to give me a partial refund or offer me a refill on my coffee (a speciality drink, so I couldn't just get a second cup myself.) 

The food itself wasn't bad, it was just not good enough to have to wait that long and between this very long mixup and some minor ones during recent visits, I think I'll stop coming by for a while.",2015-07-22 00:39:54

ORANGE MARMALADE - the 50-/+ tables were all set with jars of orange marmalade I highly doubt have been washed or replenished in the past year
BREAKFAST SANDWICH - eggs were supposed to be done medium, were served hard boiled and dry over all. Croissant was good.
BENEDICT FLORENTINE - swimming in unoriginal sauce
BABY BURGER - this was off the kids menu and cost $11. Frozen mystery meat on dry buns

I went in this morning and tried to buy a whole Kringle to go as a gift.  I KNOW they don't have fancy packing and I didn't ask too much.  All I asked was a presentable packaging. I thought it was simple since I bought the Kringle to go several times and every time I got it in a box. 

But they didn't have a big enough box to fit the Kringle today.

The waitress suggested that she could do wax paper and make it pretty. OK, as long as it's pretty to give as a present.  While the lady was packing, 2 waiters came over and said they could do it with box. Fine with me, as long as it's presentable as a gift.

The first guy tried to use 2 boxes (in fact that was the original idea I was going to tell the lady) and the second guy said no need the box! (huh?) He took 2 layers of wax paper, sandwiched a flat box, put the Kringle on the top of the wax paper, and cover it with another layer of wax paper. OMG, that was totally a disaster at this point already!! Then they tried to fold the edges of 3 layers of wax paper and then the second guy teared ANOTHER layer of wax paper to cover the entire thing AGAIN!!

Dude, even the lady next to you knew that was a LOT of paper!!! And the entire package looked like I got something mysterious and had been open and closed and open and closed several times. 

It was pretty obvious that my face didn't look pleased and I told them AGAIN that was a gift for someone's birthday and I CAN'T bring THIS as a gift.

(Kringle was the birthday girl's request and SPECIFICALLY requested Andersen's)

Would anyone be HAPPY to receive a mysterious THING covered in TONES of paper and looked like been opened several times before? At least I wouldn't.  

The second guy only said they didn't have the box again when I told them it was a gift. God, then don't sell the thing if you don't have the box for it!!! Or go back to high school for Geometry!!! All you need was 2 smaller boxes, overlap the bottom, tape from outside, put the Kringle in and close the box.  It wasn't THAT hard.

Great Pastries; Good Coffee; Adequate service, BUT Terrible Management and table policies:

While my wife was in a business meeting nearby, I stopped by this cute little bakery/cafe on a recent Monday mid-morning,  just as all the late breakfasters were leaving.

Got an outside table, one of five; noticed that it was ""waitress service"" inquired whether i could simply order a coffee and a pastry, (I was concerned about there being a minimum $ amount at the table.)

Waitstaff said of course I could sit down an simply order a coffee and pastry.

Great.  Had a $4.25 latte, (single) and it was very good.  Also had a multigrain scone, ($2.75) at a waitperson's suggestion, which was excellent.

My wife arrived around 1 hour later, just around noon, and after a glance at the menu, we decided to share a tuna sandwich, ($11.25?) which came with a green salad.

(and throughout our lunch, there remained many empty tables, both outside and inside the cafe.)

When the sandwich came, we asked the waitperson for a second plate, to facilitate sharing.  The waitperson said nothing, but brought us a second, smaller plate.

The sandwich and salad were OK, certainly not worth $11 plus bucks, but, this is a fancy little bakery and everything is pricey.

When we got our bill, we were surprised, and a bit shocked to see a $3 plate sharing charge tacked on.

We politely asked the waitperson, who told us, in no uncertain terms, that that was the policy of the cafe, and it was even on the menu!  (As if we were supposed to scan the fine print as if we were attorney's reviewing a legal document).

When we pressed, she said she was just following the cafe's rules.  (Of course, she conveniently failed to tell us about the $3 charge when we asked for  the second plate...was she a robot waiter, or just trying to build up her tip?)

After waiting for the Manager to return, we were lectured again on the cafe's policy.  I was even told that there was a $5 pastry minimum! and that that was not enforced; I was getting a break!.  Of course I pointed out that my coffee/pastry bill was $7, but that didn't phase the Manager or the rest of the staff who verbally attacked me for daring to request the $3 charge be removed,  even though we had spent over $20 before the charge, and both of us had eaten!

I calculated a 20% tip on the original bill, $20, left one dollar, and told the waitstaff to get the $3 balance from the Manager.

Came with a side of potatoes which were yummy, but the best part was the bread & jam (which is apparently made there).  I would have been happy with eating just the bread & jam alone!  We had the walnut rye which came with a strawberry jam...YUM!  Overall, the food is simple but really good yet pricey....the above plate which we shared was $15!  More than what I want to spend on breakfast.  They also have this insane $3 add on fee if you share a plate!  Don't understand why?

Service was slow, but I feel that this place is mostly filled with locals that want to just lounge around the cafe all morning, gossip, read a book, etc.

Just a tip:  for the restroom you have to request the key then go down the hall.

i got a turkey benedict where the turkey was basically deli meat you could get from the grocery store. & instead of sitting on top of an english muffin, the egg sat on top of a puff pastry (which they indicated in the menu), which i didn't like. the hollandaise sauce had a bit of a sour note to it, and not in the lemon sense either. almost vinegary? the whole concoction was just off-putting to me.

my friend's potato hash also wasn't heated thoroughly. which makes you question how exactly do their orders get prepared...?

On our last visit we decided to stop by for dessert and coffees.

It was around 7pm, Saturday night, the place was pretty empty. They had some live players, which is nice, although since it was before Thanksgiving we thought it was a bit early for X-Mas music.

We went to check out the counter and order some pieces of cake and pastries to go. It was a huge group gathered around the counter, way too inconsiderate, they took forever to order, pick and choose, etc. The guy behind the counter didn't do a good job managing the situation. Finally, the owner came and we got to order, it was so loud from that group, we were basically yelling at each other while ordering. Didn't enjoy the experience, we felt like we weren't that important. Since we couldn't see the counter, we gave up on ordering pastries to go (what we saw didn't look that fresh). 
We ordered 2 pieces of cake, I got the marzipan cake, a classic in this place, my husband got the Charlotte chocolate cake and 2 house coffees. 

They bring them at your table after you order. My husband's piece of cake looked like somebody bit from it (a mouse, some cartoon character or something). We asked for another piece.

I have to say that the cake is the most moist I've had in the entire US, like I miss from Europe (cakes in US aren't that moist). My marzipan piece was a slice of heaven, my husband's Charlotte was delicious and rich, full of chocolate, mixed with marzipan and orange marmalade.  Coffee was good, too, pretty strong. The girl that brought everything to us was nice.

What I didn't like- the prices!!! $9,95 is too much for a piece of cake, even for LA standards, even if it's this good!!!

Also, a guy who works for them starting sweeping the floors (nothing broke and it was clean) in front of us, around us. That's a major no, no for me, it spoils the atmosphere. When I'm out to eat, I want to enjoy the food, the atmosphere, the company. I don't need to see that or any behind the scenes situations!

Would I go to this place again? No, I want it to like it, but service + high prices+ this experience didn't do it for us! It lacks the European laid back charm and I so wanted that!",2014-12-09 04:33:46

It was hip and happening. Originally we were looking forward to a having brunch at the cafe but, there were no seats. So...The cupcakes, organic, all natural etc... Not worth the decision making process of which flavor  to pick, nor is it worth the calories. They  had 6 or 7 flavors, and one was vegan. I tried the oreo, the red velvet (the crushcake) and the lemon. The cakes were...dry ...almost like a soggy scone, if that makes any sense. The frosting, was like any other frosting except for the lemon...YUCK it must  have been  a bad batch. It had the lemony zing, which was good but it tasted like staled fountain lemonade. Had to have been a bad batch.

Under staffed, the counter girl was kinda out of  it, dropping things, grabbing wrong flavors, she dropped my cupcake on the counter and had actually thought about putting it in my box before looking up at me then grabbing me a new one.

Previous reviewers are correct. The hostesses were among the most angry and disgruntled people I have ever encountered and I have pretty low standards when it comes to service. I'm personally okay with angry people and bad service so that wasn't the issue... 

The issue was the food. bleh. i love places that go the organic route but not at the expense of taste. i'm usually a fan of the sweet + savory combination so i opted for the honey baked ham, cheddar and tomato scramble. it was far too sweet and just weird tasting. the bread was ok but came with honey butter which was the only part of the meal i truly enjoyed. My friend ordered the hangover helper which was a breakfast sandwich. Misnomer alert! It looked far too dry to really be a hangover helper. When I think hangover helper, I think oily or broth-y + HUGE PORTIONS (think pho, super cucas breakfast burrito, romanti ezer anything, or the super oily *Cajun Kitchen).

this is just my preliminary review because i know i will be back to try s'more food. after all, i have heard great things about their crush red velvet pancakes and the picture Min K. posted of the quiche looks like my personal heaven.

I tried their Bullet-Proof coffee, which is whipped butter, coconut oil, dark chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon. It was $4.25, so definitely expensive.

That just seems backwards - why are you serving lukewarm coffee beverages?! They put it in the microwave to heat it up for me. It just kinda tasted like buttery coffee. I can't say I was a fan. 

I also tried the red velvet pancakes and was sorely disappointed. The pancakes themselves were really bland. They were served with two diced strawberries, half a banana, thick frosting, and what they claimed was real maple syrup but *definitely* was not - I'm Canadian, I know real maple syrup when I taste it and this was absolutely not it.

Food: 3.5 stars
Service: 2 stars

First of all, this place is adorable. With the music and the decorations, I felt like I could be in a fairy tale museum.

I'll go over the food first, then I'll tackle the service...

My friend and I decided to take a load off and refuel here since we wanted to try the desserts. I ordered the Reuben sandwich. It was delicious, after I took off the relish. That combination didn't work for me, but once it was gone, I was a happy camper. The sides were tiny: I requested the side of steak fries and I got about 9, which were really small. Definitely didn't look like a normal portion. I got more coleslaw than fries. Although the portions are small for the price, it was actually a very filling meal. My friend had an open faced salmon sandwich, which she thoroughly enjoyed. It was interesting: with a boiled egg, Havarti cheese and balsamic vinegar on a flat piece of toast. But, it was tasty and gave me more ideas on how I could eat smoked salmon.

I noticed a sign that said ""Pumpkin Strip"" and a slogan that something the the effect of ""pumpkin pie but in a pastry!"" and my friend got their dutch apple cake.

The pumpkin strip was AWESOME! It was a happy marriage between pumpkin pie and a fresh crisp danish. So good!! My friend had a different experience. Her apple cake was served with whip cream and it was just ok. We thought it might be better if it was warmer (since she was hoping for a hot apple pie-like dessert) and was rebuffed. They said that's the way they served it and refused to heat it up, so she ate it begrudgingly, as she felt bad about wasting it.

Now on to the service. We decided to sit inside, since it was a seat yourself kind of place. We felt like we were ignored and my friend got up and got the menus. Our waitress came over and took our orders which was all fine and good. We got some bread, but there was a piece in there that looked like someone took a bite and put it back. When we told another server, he quickly replaced it, which was nice. However, after that he became the main person who came by (which didn't happen that often anyway).

We never got our water refilled, and in the middle of our meal (while we were both about to take another bite of our half eaten meal), the waiter brings the dessert tray over and wanted to know if we wanted to close out our check if we didn't want to order dessert. He said that he could give us the check now  and if we wanted to order dessert, we could add it on the bill.

We wanted dessert... so we told him that we'd take a look at the items in the nicely displayed counter and add it to our check. We wondered why he was so hasty to have us end our meal. The place was empty inside, except for 2 other couples. He also was the one who explicitly told my friend that they would not heat up her dessert. He tried to explain why they don't heat up that particular dessert, but I'm surprised that even though she was adamant wanted to heat it up, they still refused. 

Oddly enough, when it came time to give us our check, the original waitress (who originally abandoned us), came to the table. They were nice enough to take off her dessert, since she wasn't satisfied, but the service was still unsatisfactory.  

We came back the next day to get more of the pumpkin strip and the person behind the counter was delightful. Go figure.",2011-11-14 00:07:19

I think $3 for a good cupcake is worth it (or $3.25 at Sprinkles in L.A.), but it is a waste at Crushcakes.  Don't be fooled by the pretty frosting, because the cupcakes are less flavorful than ones made from a box.  A good cupcake has moist, tasty cake that you would be willing to eat on its own, topped off with light, flavorful frosting, which together make a wonderful combination.

I was told to call back the day before I would pick it up, so I did. I waited for a call back as the owner was not yet in at the time of my call, but when I received a return call the offer was rescinded and only a few days before the race.  As Santa Barbara is such a close knit community and has one of the highest densities of local nonprofits given its size, this type of behavior is surprising and disappointing.

Then the passerby asked to buy a cookie so that they could use the restroom and was denied service and shooed out of the restaurant. When the passerby left he stated that he was confused why he was treated so rudely, but other than that his behavior was perfectly common and respectable.

So we're roadtripping, on our way to Santa Clara to watch the Kings vs the Sharks! woohoo. Go Kings Go... We were finally getting hungry so I looked for a place to eat in Santa Barbara. The reviews looked good and 4 stars so we decided to go here.

We were seated immediately outside since there were hardly anyone outside at 8am, but the inside was full. Someone came and asked us for our drink orders right away, good start, drinks came out quickly. Then soon after the waitress came over and took our order. Glad we were ready cuz who knows if we would have seen her again... explanation coming...

Anyway, we ordered and our food came out pretty quickly also. Great! We were hungry. Babes ordered the huevos rancheros. Looked great and came on hard tortillas (tostada) fried there fresh. He said it was really good. I got the Classic breakfast with eggs over easy, bacon, potatoes and toast (sourdough multigrain). The eggs were a little undercooked, the bacon was great, the potatoes were just ok and the toast was good too. It was a decent breakfast, nothing to write home about.

Here is why this went from a 3 star to a 2 star. Our waitress NEVER came to check on us. EVER! I really like my potatoes with ketchup and salsa. No one ever came by to see if we needed anything else. Luckily I didn't wait or my food would have been ice cold waiting. The bf even had to get up and get his own coffee. She apologized to him when he went inside, but she still never came out to refill our waters or anything. I think the only reason she even brought our check was because I had to go inside to go to the restroom. 

So the service here sucked. It was just bad... I didn't want my first review on our trip to be a bad one, but I just can't do better than 2 for this place. Maybe if you sat inside you would get better service, but we were outside and the service was poor. Too bad. Now on the road to our next stop!

Update: received a really nice msg from the server and a sincere apology therefore I am happy to make it 3 stars instead of two. I always appreciate when the businesses are on top of making sure their customers are happy! Thanks!!",2015-02-21 16:56:29

Then when I would call to explain their mistakes, they would tell me to take it up with sbmenus, even though they were the ones who got my order and were in charge of packing the food, and even with my phone calls the problem persists. At this point I feel like they are doing it on purpose, is it really that hard to double check an order before handing it to sbmenus?

Waited about 20 min before given a menu. Had to wait to then order drinks. Waitress, who was also cohosting showed up and said only 2 high chairs- both in use, would bring me one when free. Never happened. Right after I ordered drinks, is when male waiter came and asked if he could get me drinks. Told him had just ordered those asked about kid's menu. None! He suggested a la cart eggs with bacon or a la carte crepe with ricotta cheese. Ordered one egg scrambled with cheddar cheese and 1 crepe. Got approx 2 scrambled eggs and bacon and crepe - just as toddler arrived. 

Different waitress brought drinks out and looked very angry when I told her a male waiter had taken order for toddler I was expecting. NEVER came back with requested glass of ice she promised - ice tea showed up with very little ice. 

Lady who was sitting in table next to me left after I asked for menu and to order drinks. When nothing happened for next 5 minutes. She then came back and got something to go at bakery counter.

Guess 2 more people came to ask to take our order while we were gone.

Wrote 0 in tip space and a note re: service. Then tried to talk to woman who seemed to be in charge. She didn't care. Just smirked and kept saying "" Ok and Thank You!""

I'm a native Santa Barbaran that decided to give Andersen's a series of tries after having not gone in quite awhile. First was on Labor Day and I chose the Charlotte Omelet with mozzerlla cheese (they were out of the Brie) which looked amazing but was quite bland and lacking the Wow Factor. The omelet was also very thin and to me, a good one is fluffy with lots of yolk taste to it. 
Second time was right after their summer break and I ordered another omelet which was the veggie one and that was also very bland but worse was the very al dente green peppers dominating the whole dish. And it seemed the mozzerella cheese was MIA till I got to the last few bites (looks like it suffered from shrinkage, lol) . 
Third charmless time was last night when I ordered the ground sirloin Danish -named dish I can't remember name of but it begins with an H. I was hoping for something really special given that it's a long-time menu item but all it was was a dry hamburger patty with grilled onions on it. The potatoes were amazing though--and I wonder, why can't they use spices on their entrees the way they do with the sides? 
Anyway, I have to say the service was above and beyond exceptional. And knowing Mrs. Andersen and fam in passing over the years it is disappointing that such a sweet family has a business I can't say good things about. Their little place is so cute and the pastries are heavenly, it just seems to be the cook that needs improvement. The marzipan cake needs some International award as it's been my favorite cake since I was a kid getting treated to it on my birthday. Also the French Waffles are classics I'd buy when I'd stroll downtown in the 70s and 80s. Now they are too expensive but I understand the cost increase, ie overhead of rent, prep costs, etc.

I got there after my family and they mentioned to me that we needed to order at the front. That wasn't quite evident and it would be helpful to have that some signage or on the menus.

The cafe area was a lot smaller than expected, and since it was raining they were unable to have their outdoor seating available. It is not really good for more than 2 people because of the size of the tables and the arrangement of the area, but we made it work.

I decided that I had to try a cupcake and decided on the hangover helper breakfast sandwich: stuffed with eggs, melted cheddar, applewood bacon, tomatoes, toasted sour dough bread  and the chai tea latte. 

My brother had cafe skillet potatoes & eggs: two fried eggs served with roasted potatoes, anaheim chiles, red peppers, applewood smoked bacon, and melted cheddar and jack cheese (NOT served on a skillet) and the mayan mocha.

My mom had chicken ranch quesadilla roasted chicken, anaheim chiles, peppers, onions, tomatoes, jack and cheddar cheeses and our kicked up cilantro ranch dressing and a regular house coffee. I had a bite and it was pretty good. Maybe a little too much dressing, though.

My brother was surprised that his ""skillet"" dish came without one and was disappointed in that I'm sure it would have kept his food piping hot. He really enjoyed his mocha, though.

My sandwich was great, although I wondered if my eggs were real or if they were a mix. They tasted ok, but seemed a little too square to be regular eggs. The side of fruit was nice; a mix of strawberries, bananas and grapes. I'm not a huge fan of grapes, but these were awesome. They outshined both the other fruit. Chai tea latte was a-ok.

After much debate, I got a lemondrop cupcake. I tried the cupcake portion without the frosting and there isn't that much lemon flavor in it. They definitely relied on the frosting to deliver the lemon taste. It's great as a combination, but if you are one of those people who want all the flavor in the cake, this might not do it for you. (My mom hates frosting and scrapes it all off, for her, she would have been highly disappointed.) I would have liked to have a little more lemon flavor in the cupcake, but love the frosting.

It's not too far off the 101 exit and is in a fairly nice shopping complex.  It's not a chain, but they have several locations in Los Angeles.

We came around lunch time and there was a fairly consistent number of people going into the cafe.  It's fairly small but has a lot of outdoor patio seating.  This is where we chose to sit.

I ordered the almond croissant as I felt I wouldn't have truly experienced Renaud's without doing so.  It was awesome!  Sweet, rich, and full of flavor.  It's truly a treat and worth checking out the cafe for.  I had the oven roasted chicken sandwich for lunch.  It came with a little salad on this side.  The sandwich was good, but it wasn't special in any way.  I could have made the same exact thing at home.

Patio seating is wonderful.  We came on one of those idealistic days where it's not hot when sitting in the sun, and not cold sitting in the shade.  The fountain has been drained (guessing due to the drought) but it's not really hurting the feel.  Some of the chairs are uncomfortable to sit in for more than scarfing down food.

Service was okay.  My sandwich came out fast but it took a long time before my brother-in-law got his food so we all waited and talked amongst ourselves and waited, and kept talking, and waited and looked at the time on our phones and then his food came out and he had ordered the pasta dish.

She takes my plate away, and 10 minutes later comes back -- with my quiche, and the same green salad. She produces  the receipt and tells me I didn't order a fruit salad. 

Frst of all, I did order the fruit salad. Perhaps the guy taking my order didn't hear me. But thats not the point -- I asked for a fruit salad, I wanted a fruit salad, I was not going to be happy with a green salad. So why come back with all the attitude, and not give me what I wanted? It wasn't about the money, I would have gladly paid more if that is what it took. It is about Renauds taking responsibility for itsncustomers happiness -- and doing whatever it takes to make customers, especially loyal ones like me, happy. 

I was thoroughly disgusted with Renauds. Is this how little regard they hold for their customers? Was it really easier to go hunt down the receipt and come to my table to prove I was wrong than it would have been to just bring me the fruit salad that I wanted?

I got the Scottish Salmon Benedict...which turned out to be a big disappointed...the hollandise sauce wasn't great, it was a bit too sour and the salmon pieces were small. The bread that they put it on was at least better than the normal, it was crispy and flaky. My friend got the vanilla bean french toast, which turned out to be a bigger disappointment then the salmon benedict! The sauce was all thick and too creamy, it was like clam chowder thrown on the plate. They should have soaked the french toast in the vanilla bean before they cook it. It was too overwhelming. The only good thing about this place was the fresh bakery. They had complimentary blueberry danish thing, it was good.

8XHmsATholT-uy5gGNWomQ,W83aZrDrYKwycCHB_eOYYg,Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g,3,4,0,0,"NOTE: This was my first meal at Andersen's (I know, bizarre, here in SB all these years) and they did not have the traditional breakfast offerings. It was a holiday brunch (Memorial or Labor Day). I may upgrade to a 4 but for now it's a 3 for the following reasons: 

1) Expensive! 

My friend loves it here, reminds him of Stellenbosch (South African upscale area near Cape Town, and I want to try the generous, reasonably priced chicken liver pate and also the pickled herring,which he adores.) I had no idea the bill for an entree , coffee and one mimosa would be 25 pre-tip! 

This was MORE money than Maggie's, at least for the food! And not nearly as good. I had ""Charlotte's omelet"" which at 14.95 was pretty pricey. It is huge and I thought the brie and tomatoes with garlic and spinach were all great but the omelet was brown on top! 

The point of going out for an omelet in part is to get a fluffy yellow omelet with no trace of brown. I don't cook but I do make eggs on occasion and there is always some brown on top. (Mom's omelets for Dad which she only started to make in the last two years of their 47 year marriage are very brown.) 

The flavor was good and the potatoes were fine--nothing special but decent--but for 14.95 it didn't wow me and it was the least of the brunch egg dishes. I asked them to leave off the bacon but they brought out two of the omelets, one for my friend who asked them to leave the bacon in, and we got halfway through our omelets before we realized he got mine and I got his. All the bacon was in the second half of my omelet so I didn't realize it until I found the first piece of bacon. 

I am a carnivore but I do NOT want meat anywhere near my eggs: no ham, no sausage, no chorizo, no steak. We switched plates and it was fine. 

2) It's darling but when you sit down (they work in ""teams"") a server asks if you've made your decision in 30 seconds after getting the menu. Uh, no. Then another server comes to ask you 90 seconds later. Another minute or two later, yet another person comes over. 

I finally said, nicely but firmly,  ""I'm sorry, no, we haven't. I eat out every day I'm in SB , once if not twice, and I have to say I've never been asked three times in the space of 4 minutes if I'm ready to order."" 

He said that sometimes happens because they ""work in teams"": what does that even MEAN? I grew up eating out and with a seven year hiatus in depression, have been eating regularly in restaurants since I was a child. My aunt and uncle were in the restaurant business for decades and my sister for some 15 years and I have never heard of this ""team philosophy"" of serving. Bizarre. 

3) They do refill the coffee regularly, which would be better if the coffee were above average. It's all right, not bilge water like Steve's Patio Cafe or Esau's both of which I like very much--but it's not great. 

They brought us a free Napoleon for no reason I can determine and it was great. I didn't eat the crust part but it was a nice treat. 

I had a really great time with a friend and am glad we went there. But I would never go to the price-elevated holiday brunch again. I can't wait to try the chicken liver. There is only ONE in town I like: Arlington Tavern. It's chopped liver not pate and I love it. We have no Jewish delis here and Gelson's chopped liver is positively putrid, like so bad you take a bite, brush your teeth and dump it down the garbage disposal. 

I will be back but never for a ""special brunch."" The ""Viking Mimosas"" are 2 for 12. Good deal and good juice in a large class but low on booze. They have happy hour, which I didn't know, with 5 dollar glasses. 

Finally, while the decor is not the kind which generally appeals to me--it's cutesy and pink in the main area, more Victorian England than Danish it seems to me based on my Solvang excursions--I did find it charming. My grandmother would have loved the decor.  Next time, I would prefer to sit in the far room with oil paintings, but no one was at those tables and I assumed it was not yet open.",2013-09-02 21:06:54

I personally went into their location on 3 different occasions to confirm that they would be able to make cupcakes on my wedding date and deliver them to my wedding location. I was told each time that it was no problem and that i should just call a couple days ahead of time to give them my flavor choices.

Let me give you a few of her quotes...when i said..""i come from la and stop at your cupcake place every single time we are in town and thats why we booked you""....her response: ""thats because we have the best cupcakes""........when i asked about the fact that i had been confirmed 3 times...her response was: ""i cannot control everything my employees say""....she also told me that ""even if you placed this order 6 months ago i would not do it"" WHAT?!?! Of course i told her that she was a terrible business person. Bottom line...she made it clear that she did not care AT ALL that because of the 3 confirmations that i got from HER and her employees, i made no alternative arrangements for dessert at my wedding. She didnt offer to work it out with my caterer...she didnt offer anything...just ""sorry theres nothing i can do"". Brides do not trust this vendor. Heartless.

Ordered custom sea urchin cake through Wayne Kjar, went through all details of what the cake would be from the size, shape, coloration, details on the cake, fondant, types of cake and filling in each layer and also the chocolates to go around cake which was supposed to be 12 white chocolates sea creature shapes colored and 12 dark chocalates sea creatures and colored. I also sent a picture of exactly how the cake was supposed to be.

What I ordered and what I got were completely different, when I saw the cake on my wedding day 30 minutes before the start of my wedding ceremony I remained calm on the outside, but was in total shock on the inside. I was very unamused to see a cake that was much less than what was agreed upon. Still people loved it that did not know how it was supposed to be, the few that knew the specifics said it was lacking compared to what I agreed to, but still was a neat cake.

The cakes fondant was solid blue and had small cracks in many places, which it was supposed to be a mix of blue and green to be like the sea urchin cake in picture.

 The white dot detailing was on the cake and looked good.

The base was supposed to look as if it had black sand around the base of cake as in picture which I liked, cake came with brown sugar which was tan around base which I didn't like as much.

Another big detail that was a very very bad mistake was the chocolates, I agreed to 12 colored sea creature white chocolate flavor and 12 colored dark chocolates. All cocolates ended up being white chocolate with no colors:( The top two chocolates were supposed to be Starfish representing my partner and I and were supposed to be colored yellow, instead on top of my cake were just two stars and plain white, no starfish to be found. My partner hates white chocolate and there was no dark chocolates to be had, very dissappointing.

The reason the review is 3 stars is because of the cake inside. The white cake with bavarian cream and fresh strawberries was very moist and was taste very good, everyone like the cake. The chocolate cake with bavarian cream was just as moist and taste very good aswell. I was surprised the cake was actually better tasting than the taste test.

Overall the cake was well recieved by our guests but to be truthful it was lacking in so many aspects that were important to me and my partner for our wedding day cake. It just did not meet the requirments agreed upon for the cake that I made with Wayne Kjar for my wedding day cake, very dissappointing...",2013-11-03 01:33:08

The place is as cute as could be, and in a great location. We were starving and the prices seemed reasonable for the area, so we grabbed a chair outside to enjoy the beautiful weather while we ate lunch. 

I had the ham and cheese sandwich, which was good, but a little disappointing. The menu said it was like a croque monsieur, so I was expecting a grilled ham and cheese. What I got was ham and melted cheese with fat slices of pineapple on a soft french roll. The ham and cheese were good, but it was hard to eat because of the thick pineapple that kept sliding around.  Hubby had a roast beef & havarti sandwich, which he enjoyed very much.  We both agreed that the quality of the meats and cheeses was very good. 

We shared a slice of apple cake for dessert, which was an interesting item--like the insides of an apple pie held together with gelatin. We liked it because it was light and not very sweet, but I can see that it would not satisfy the average American's notion of dessert.

Everyone had just a hint of citrus to it and the sugar pearls on top made the whole cupcake stand out. Then there's the Strawberry Blush cupcake...that I did not finish.

The team that works there is so so nice and the place is so adorable and homey.  The Apple turnover wasn't what I would have expected unfortunately. The pastry shell had almonds on it which I don't like on an Apple turnover.  There was lots of sugar on the pastry shell.  I highly recommend not adding additional sugar on top of the pastry shell.

I had one very small coffee sitting at the table for $3.25. Plain coffee! Also didn't bring me my ticket but grabbed my credit card and charged it before I knew what the cost was and being in a hurry I signed and left. So my guess is she charged $8 for whip cream for my kids and a second coffee on top of the first $3.25 cup of coffee.. this isn't France people. Get a grip on yourselves.,2018-01-30 17:28:38

The waitstaff were fine this time.  But the owner is very very unpleasant.  We just moved here and tried to pay with a starter check.  Instead of explaining her policy of not accepting checks,  she upbraided me. Extremely rude and unpleasant.  Yes,  they may be family owned.  But they are not a family I will be giving my money to in the future.

P.S. - as per my comment, you can see the attitude (""it is not acceptable"") of the owners here (below). It's normal where I come from to receive the bill, write a check to pay it (including tip), and leave. I had no idea it was Andersen's policy to refuse checks. This reply to a ""valued customer"" is just the icing on the cake. These people would rather ""win"" than make everyone happy. Message to ""family business"" owner - this isn't your home - this is a service industry - be nice to the customers, and assume the best about them - at least to their face - even if you fear the worst privately.

P.P.S. - the rude behaviour - the upbraiding - came even after I offered to (a) pay in cash (b) have them call the credit union to confirm the account (c) provide multiple forms of documentation including passports, birth certificates, etc, which I happened to have on me (having just been to the DMV). Again - little interest in getting payment. Lots of interest in being domineering. I would hate to be an employee at that place.

P.P.P.S - Hilarious. Just noticed that the management editing their comment again to add ""non-bank"" to ""check"" - yes - that ""non-bank"" is a credit union. A big one. ""Oh no, we don't accept checks from member-owner financial institutions."" Say what?",2013-07-09 20:11:06

XTseG8LAWTGotekgvMMC8A,zecq0D1C283rHNRKy2Ln9w,YrNtBUOUOYwmRZ_UVwH8iQ,1,18,6,4,"Ok, so my wife, our toddler and I are walking around downtown Santa Barbara. We get a little hungry and pick up two slices of pizza for us and a hot dog for our toddler at a couple of places along State St.

We planned on stopping at one of the public benches to enjoy our food, but the one we found had gum on the seat so we kept walking towards our hotel. With no more public benches in sight, we stumble upon D'Angelo's Bakery. 

We initially walked past the place, but then thought, there are four outdoor tables open and no one inside the place... if we buy something from them, we could eat that and our other food at one of their four open outside tables. Actually, our toddler had long finished his hot dog by this time, so it was just our two lonely slices of pizza that needed eating.

We went inside hoping to buy a baguette and an espresso drink or two. The espresso machine was apparently broken because they had a little sign saying that no espresso drink were available so we settled for a sourdough baguette. The woman at the counter was very friendly and helpful.

We grabbed our baguette and headed to one of the four open tables on the sidewalk in front of the place. We started eating the baguette and our pizza. A few minutes later, another one of D'Angelo's employees came out and said that the tables were for food ordered to eat at D'Angelos. We pointed to our baguette and said that we purchased food from D'Angelos. The young woman said that the baguette is a to go item and the tables are for food ordered to eat at D'Angelo's. She said the owner didn't want us eating other food there. We protested and she said, you can stay this time.

At that point, I was rather miffed. We used to own a coffee house and I can certainly understand being annoyed at people who come in to a place with food from outside places to eat without ordering something. I made a point to purchase something from this business so we could use one of their outside tables AND I only did it because there was only one other person patronizing the place at the time. It wasn't like we were taking a table from other customers who ordered ""eat in"" food either.

I asked if the owner was available and walked inside to speak with him. I mentioned to him that we had purchased something from him specifically so we could eat at one of his tables and we wouldn't have sat down at one of his tables without patronizing his business. He totally disregarded that and said they were about to close. It was 10 minutes until 2PM and he acted like we were keeping him from closing up shop at 2, and he was quite rude about it.

I again tried to explain that we were trying to be respectful by buying something from him. He ignored that again and dismissively reiterated that he was closing at 2PM and that was the reason he didn't want us eating there. The funny thing is that the one customer who was there when we sat down didn't seem to be getting the same attitude at all.

I left the establishment after I told him that I obviously made a mistake by buying something from D'Angelo's. I felt like throwing the mostly intact baguette on his counter, but I refrained and tried giving it to a homeless guy down the street. I guess he wasn't a fan either because he politely declined.",2009-06-26 05:46:19

Second, I repeatedly asked for more water...never got it.  And my hot chocolate, which I've thoroughly enjoyed in the past, was this time tepid, not sweet and the cream felt and tasted like clotted cream.  Maybe that was the intention but it was definitive not worth $6.

However, service was at first a bit pushy-dunno if that's because it was kind of slow so they were checking on us a lot.  We had never been before, so we needed time to look over the menu.  We asked for more time...then asked again from another server...then from a third, all in the span of about 4 minutes.  Then, once all members of staff had ascertained for themselves that we needed more time, they gave it to us.  Boy, did they.  We used the international symbol for ""we're ready to order"": put menus down, napkins in lap and looked up expectantly.  Nothing for a while.
The free pastry thing was great.  Fabulous idea.
Fiance asked for orange juice.  It never came.  Upshot: we weren't charged for it.
I had the cheese plate, as I mentioned, and it was wonderful.  I thought it could have used some fresh fruit, but the excellence of their marmalade nearly made up for that.
Fiance had the sampler of 4 pastries.  Disappointment.  They looked beautiful, but seemed a bit stale.  And perhaps it's just a personal pet peeve, but I like to know what food is in front of me...would have been awesome if the server had said, ""Well, this is that, and that is this"" etc.  We could recognize the apple strudel, and it looked delish, but was disappointingly hard.  The scone was a scone...not always a favorite for me, admittedly.  There was some sort of other filled pastry-the pastry was flaky and nice, but I'm still not sure what the filling was...dates? Prunes? Figs?  And the fourth pastry was (I think) almond, but undercooked a bit.  
Have to say their coffee was good, though, and the service was friendly, if a little desperate.
We will go again, however, as fiance feels that he just has ""bad breakfast juju"" and anyplace we try for the first time, he'll order something he doesn't love.  The benedict on the table next to ours looked great.",2010-12-15 19:39:40

An authentic Danish bakery doesn't serve danishes with cream cheese. Stay away from those monstrosities.

It's seems though, that D'Angelo's is a place of extremes. The first time I went in, I ordered French Toast with a poached egg. It was delicious and the poached egg, which I ordered medium, was perfect!

On my next visit, I ordered a couple fried eggs, over-medium, and ham. The ham was fine, but the eggs were so badly destroyed, I couldn't believe they served them. (See my picture.)

I swear on my life that I can fry two eggs, over-medium, blindfolded and not have them turn out burned or mangled, like the travesty that arrived on my plate last Sunday. 

This disastrous eggs-perience (sorry, I had to do that), combined with the extremely sub-par croissant I got there recently, leaves me with no choice but stick with two stars.

Firstly they've redone their Santa Barbara location to seat more people, which is great; however, it appears that the employees are still trying to figure out sharing one counter for cafe and cupcakes. The line I stood in took almost 15 minutes, note there were only two people in front of me. When I got to the counter there was absolutely no coffee (it happens). But when I spy other employees ""chilling"" and when I get to the counter there's no coffee I'm a little pissed off.

The reason this is only a 2-star review is because I couldn't wrap my head around the cost of a single buckwheat waffle, with nothing but butter and maple syrup to accompany it, being $8.95. Couldn't they put a couple pieces of sliced fruit as garnish at least?

We've been going to Renaud's for 7 years now, their pastries, tarts, cakes, everything is just amazing. Customer service on the other hand is just terribly terrible! And it's been always terrible throughout all these years among all of their locations and we've seen many many different people working there. So I guess kudos to their management for putting this much effort to be consistently terrible all these years, it takes real leadership to always suck. The people working at Renaud's seem to really hate their jobs and don't make the slightest effort to keep customers happy. Everytime my wife and I go there we tell each other that we will never come back but then 2 weeks later we crave their awesome apricot tart or the heavenly refreshing peach mint iced tea and we find ourselves back in there again. Today I ordered a baker's basket which is a croissant + baguette + jam + orange juice and a choice of tea/coffee. So really plain and simple and something extremely hard to screw up. But lo and behold they managed to disappoint again! My order came without any jam and the gentleman who brought it didn't mention anything about it. I then realized that the jam is missing and called him back and asked for the jam (hoping that they have simply forgotten, how naive am I?) and then he said we're out of jam!!! Well then why didn't you say it when you brought my order? Were you hoping that I would not notice the missing jam while eating a plain dry baguette?!!! I then went to the same cashier who took our order and told her that I didn't get my jam cause looks like you were out of it and if I knew this first I would've ordered something else. She just looked at me and said ""yes we're out of jam, can I do anything for you""?!!! So it was obvious that she knew they were out of jam when I placed my order and didn't say anything! I know at this point you're probably saying why is this grown a** guy making a big fuss for a jam? I completely agree with you and to be honest, the jam is not even that special but today I just had it and decided that I have to write this review for all of these years!

I brought my husband in for lunch and the young man behind the counter was fantastic and our meal was delicious!! My husband had the ""burger"" and said it was better than a meat burger and my soup was excellent. 
This week, however, I brought a friend who is curious about vegan food and we did not have a good experience. The gal behind the counter never smiled, said the kale salad did not come with the traditional avocado dressing due to a shortage of avocados? I hadn't heard that. She failed to mention that the salad also did not come with avocados like it's supposed to until I asked. We opted for the eggplant salad instead which was basically a bowl of arugula with oil and a few slices of oily eggplant, no flavor. We each had the soup, which while delicious, was just luke warm and very small portions for the price. 
Also, it was soooooo loud in the sitting area, even after closing the door, that we had to shout to hear each other. They could use some textured materials to absorb the noise and make it more cozy.

The mother was trying to buy pastries. They were very busy and the daughter was bouncing a small ball in the bakery. She was not hurting anyone. She appeared to be special needs. The manager ran up to her and in a mean tone told her to stop. The girl stopped and then moved to the back of restaurant where there was no one and she bounced the small ball.

After driving a couple of hours to Santa Barbara, my friend and I stumbled upon Andersen's bakery and decided to get lunch. The place was full of patrons, so it had to be good, right?

Just stepping foot inside brought out the quaint and delicate nature within me that tends to get lost in Los Angeles. I could just imagine myself sipping on tea and eating delicious pastries with my pinkie extended into the air. Everything about the ambiance was wonderful from the decoration to the delicious looking desserts and pastries displayed near the counter. Our server was nice enough, and took our order, which was quickly followed by a small assortment of breads and half a hot cross bun to munch on while we waited for our food (Why they don't give a whole bun is beyond me). This, my friends, was the peak of my eating experience. *cue sad face*

Everything just went downhill from there and I will explain why:
1. I ordered a club sandwich. Now, it's hard to f@&k up a club sandwich, but this place did. Since there's the option to choose which bread you'd like, I decided to go with a delicious, freshly baked croissant. Apparently they ran out of croissants, and did not tell me. They automatically made the club with wheat toast, assuming that's what I would like. How very wrong they were. I've never been so sad to see a sandwich in my life. How could they down grade from a croissant to wheat toast without asking my permission? It was an abomination, but to avoid wasting food (and waiting for a new order) I decided to keep it. The sandwich was ok, but all I kept thinking about was the croissant and how much better it would have been. On another note, the steak fries are awesome and I've had better coleslaw at KFC.

2. After eating my reject sandwich, I decided to get dessert. Everything LOOKED delicious. Key word being ""looked."" I ordered a slice of the lemon mousse cake and my friend ordered a slice of the Danish apple cake. The lemon mousse cake was more of a pie that had a sad excuse for a crust. I normally enjoy tart and tangy desserts, but this went to the next level. It was way too sour, so I stopped after a few bites. My friends apple cake looked good also, but I'd have to say hers was worse than mine. Nothing about this was a cake. there was no crust or bready consistency whatsoever. It was a gelatinous combination of apples, cinnamon, and other blobby stuff. Not to mention it was cold. I don't know about you, but when I order apple desserts, 99% of the time it's warm.

3. The service was mediocre at best. Listen, I was a server for two years and I understand how difficult and busy it could be. I get it and that's fine, but at least fill our drinks and check to see how we're doing every once in a while. And next time, let me know before you decide to change my sandwich order without my permission.

Maybe I'm being overly harsh and picky, but I've had better eating experiences at more ordinary restaurants. I'm sure it's a lovely place when things go right, but that just wasn't the case for me.",2011-04-19 05:37:59

When I first started coming here, I got a fresh batch of cupcakes and it would be like, after 3pm ( because I drive from Ventura and I don't leave my house at the butt crack of dawn for much ). It was amazing, I was infatuated..I loved the vanilla bean, and I liked the surprise of the daily cupcakes and mini's.

After a while everything went to shit, their cupcakes got worse, and worse...Dry, frosting tasted old, definitely not fresh, and on top of that..The ladies who were once nice working there, all seemed to turn into bitches or just apathetic. And I'm not really into that.

Second impressions are important: Iced tea. I was going to ask for lemon but then I saw a quarter of a thin lemon slice floating in the tea. Not the customary wedge. It would be rude to ask ""can I have some lemon?"" because they obviously think this tea HAS lemon. 

I ordered the Charlotte salad, described as having ""seasonal fresh fruit, roasted walnuts, dried cranberries and bleu cheese."" Sounds good. The actual salad was mixed greens with about 2-3 sliced strawberries on top, a very light sprinkling of bleu cheese, and so few candied walnut pieces that I couldn't see, let alone taste, them, and a few dried cranberries. Do they consider these little candied things roasted walnuts? The balsamic ""vinaigrette"" which was on the side tasted like pure vinegar and there was nothing (like roasted walnuts or bleu cheese) to offset it. Once I ate the strawberry/ies, I was done. The server asked me if I was ""still enjoying it?"" (code for are you done?) and I said ""No I didn't care for it."" and he said okay. 

The restroom was messy, water and paper on the floor, and no paper towels. 

My husband ordered a sandwich and a salad as his side. They brought the sandwich with fries. He didn't mention it and ate the fries. But we were charged to ""upgrade"" from fries to salad. They apologized and adjusted the bill. This is hardly worth mentioning, but by this time I'm in total disappointment mode. 

On the plus side, 1) atmosphere is relaxed, pleasant and unrushed, fresh linens on the tables, 2) service is courteous and friendly 3) coffee cake sample was absolutely delicious. 4) My husband really liked his sandwich.

I want to come by for tea, or for breakfast, on my way to work or for lunch. BUT I have continued to be disappointed by your service, and it has never improved - here are just a few examples. I came in for a bagel and cream cheese at about 8:50. When I have gone to Jeannine's, Peet's, Starbucks, and French Press at the same time (I have to work at 9, down the street) ten minutes has been plenty of time to toast a bagel and hand it to me.

When I finally received the bagel, almost 20 minutes later, it was not toasted but limp, slightly wet and grilled (?) with a HUGE brick of cream cheese just placed in between. In 20 minutes, you couldn't even spread the cream cheese?

Another time I called in an hour ahead of time to order a small box of mini cupcakes to pick up at 8:45. I arrived at 8:45 and your staff seemed surprised about the order, and BEGAN assembling it when I arrived. I was again late to work, as once again I stood and watched for over 15 minutes while someone in the back slowly placed a few cupcakes in a small box.

Every time and go and ask they do seem genuinely disappointed to tell me that there are none - but who is doing anything to change this?

I know. We have Asian face and you prob think that Asians do not understand how tips work in America. Alright. You could just put 'recommend: 15% 18% 20%' on the bill and we choose what to pay according to the service. Frankly, I don't even like the feeling that people remind me how much I should pay because, come on, I have been living in California for more than 3 years and I never tip less than any American. Great service deserves more tips and I would be generous and happy to tip.
However, this restaurant adds the gratuity of 18% automatically on the bill. First, I know restaurants do add gratuity automatically for a party of six or above. But we are only four girls coming for brunch. Second, the service was just okay. Friendly but not very attentive. Last but not the least, it's not like we are having a nice dinner in a fancy restaurant. This is a brunch place at the street, casual, chilling and on a Friday morning, I really don't feel any reason that you add the gratuity for us except one that is you think we would not tip you because we look Asians. Plus, based on the service, how dare you charge 18%, which I totally do not agree.

Finally we paid the bill, of course. But to be honest, I don't really think I'm coming back and I could just imagine when I hang out with local friends, the bill won't come out like that.

The cookies &creme had such a delicious frosting flavor but unfortunately my cupcake dried out by the time I ate it so I can't comment on the cake itself (my fault though because it was sitting in my car for like 6 hours).

The food has always been good, but that is not what I am complaining about.  The service  is terrible, almost every time I go there.  This morning really made me hit the boiling point, and I really doubt that I will go back, despite the fact that it is 1 block from my office.  The woman at the register was obviously very tired and couldn't remember my simple order of a pastry and coffee.  She had to ask twice what pastry I wanted.  After she took my order, she began helping the person after me but had to stop because she started coughing on EVERYTHING.  I am just glad she had already handed me my scone because she coughed on all of the baked goods.  People in the food service industry should NOT go to work sick.  The owners/managers should definitely discourage this.  Then I started my long wait.  There was only one person who ordered a drink in front of me in line, just one, but I also had to wait until the person that ordered after me got their beverage, and then some.  I waited for 15 minutes for a latte.  There was no apology from the servers, no sense of urgency. At one point the woman at the register walked by me and said, ""your latte is almost ready"".  Great.  I can see that the baristo literally just started my latte.  So then I wait some more.  

At another visit, where I ordered online to try to cut down on the wait time during my lunch break from work, I still ended up waiting over 20 minutes for a to-go order due to negligence on the staff side.  I ordered online about 30 minutes before I went to the restaurant and made a note that I wanted no cheese on my sandwich and a side of salad dressing for my salad.  Apparently they do not read the notes because after arriving at the restaurant, and waiting 10 minutes for my order, I received what I ordered with cheese on the sandwich.  I had to send it back, telling them that there should be no cheese and salad dressing on the side of the salad.  I waited another 10 minutes for my sandwich to be remade.  When I finally received it, it looked like they had just scraped the cheese off the bread and still had no salad dressing for my salad.  I thought this would be my last time there, but I like to give people chances.  I am done, SO DONE.  

Also, why don't you try serving vegan and gluten free cupcakes on a regular basis?

I have noticed that the quality had gone down just a little bit recently, but there was nothing to put up a red flag. The pastries still tasted lovely. I was helping to throw a breakfast for the 75 teachers and faculty members at Laguna Blanca school. The breakfast was for 7:15am on a Monday morning, so I called Renaud's the prior Friday to arrange pastries and quiches for 75 people. They said no problem on the quiches, but for the pastries, they would not have time to put them on platters or deliver the food to the school, and I said that it was no problem. We would pick up the quiches and pastries and plate the food ourselves. They were to be ready between 7am and 7:15 AM. I figured that even if it was 715am, it would have been fine as the school is only a five minute drive away. I paid in advance. Big mistake! sent a staff member of mine to pick everything up at 7am. At 8:04 AM, he was finally given the food! The teachers all start TEACHING at 8 AM! There was a reason that the food was supposed to be ready between 7 AM and 7:15 AM. The quiches arrives ICE cold and the pastries were AN HOUR LATE getting to the school. So, I ended up spending a small fortune only to disappoint these wonderful human beings that shape our children's lives. I cannot understand how they can run a catering business this way. If they could not have handled this order, they could have told us by Saturday afternoon. I would have gone to Jeannine's, where I should have gone in the first place. Her son graduated from Laguna Blanca, and she actually appreciates taking care of the teachers at the school! On top of this, they actually fed first responders during the mudslides last year. Jeanine's was honored by Foodbank during their annual dinner! When I called Renaud's to complain, they admitted it was indeed their error, but refused to do anything to make it up to the teachers and after much pushing, offered us $20 back. Obviously it cost us more than $20 to have our employee stand there waiting for an hour for the food. This went all the way up to the corporate office and that was the end result. They were unhelpful and extraordinarily unprofessional! I actually sit on a few boards in town and donate to many other nonprofits and plan to spread the word.

We were on our way from Santa Maria and phoned in our order at 2:15pm to dine in at 2:30pm. We specifically requested to dine-in. Once we arrived, we paid the bill and our order was delivered to us in a to-go bag. Okay, fine. The person who took our order over the phone was a female, and the cashier who took our order was the only female in Renaud's. Therefore, one has to assume that the name on the receipt, Kiersten, is the one who received our phone order with instructions to serve the food for dine-in. Once we received our order in a bag, we sat down and unloaded the food on a table. We later found that we did not receive any butter and jam for the croissant. No biggie, I'll get up and ask for some. I ask Kiersten for some butter and jam, and she silently grabs some and hands them to me. I say thank you to her loud and clear, and she ignored me. It's one thing when someone doesn't want to be friendly, but when you are working with customers, I expect some sort of acknowledgement so that I, as a customer, can feel welcome for a small service that I paid for.

We ate our food, and it tasted mediocre which is way less than expected at this establishment. I don't know if our mood was lost, or we received the unwelcome service before the kitchen closed that resulted in poorly tasting food. How unfortunate. In addition to our experience, the other employees were two young males who were both chatting and laughing in a very loud manner as if no one was around.

When he returns with my drink, I ask him if he just warmed up my drink and he said yes. I right away tell him, I'd like a new drink and that warming up milk burns the milk, and gives it s different taste. In my mind I'm thinking  I just paid for this $4 drink I'd at least like to enjoy it. When he brings it back he just drips it off on the table I'm waiting, with an attitude.

I was looking forward to trying this place out after my brother had been raving about it for the last year to me. I finally got the chance and my experience was....a let down.

The service was not the problem at all. The staff was as helpful and as friendly as you would expect with explanations at the ready for any questions you might have. 

My problem is one of the two things that are a cornerstone for all baked goods for me: moistness. I tried their Black and White cupcake and the mini version of their chocolate cupcake.  For me, the cakes seemed on the dry side.  Even the mini was the same for me. Like I said, maybe it was on an off day or late in the day to be getting cakes from them. Until I try them again, and I am willing to give this place a second try, I'll keep the 3 star rating as is. As for the other cornerstone, sweetness level, I'll give it a pass. It's definitely not as overly sweet as most places I've been to, but it's far from bland. Would I suggest you try this place? Definitely. Your taste buds may not find anything wrong with their cakes. They also have a breakfast menu (served until 2 pm) and a lunch menu. Kids menue are included too.

Parking: All street and definitely a luck of the draw if you want one close by to the shop. There is paid parking too if all else fails. 

Location: Keeps your eyes peeled because this shop looks (and probably was in it's past) like a former residence turned into a shop. Lots of nooks and crannies for seating around every corner. Even outdoor patio that must have been a garden/backyard at some point. The bathroom looks like something you'd find in a private home too. Cute decor and plants all over the place.

Cons:
Eggs Benedict was mediocre. It is served on puff pastry which I decided to give a try and i honestly would have preferred the traditional English muffin. The hollandaise sauce was a very strange; it had a tart taste to it that was a complete turn off for me. I actually tried to scrape as much of it off as i could! I would not order it again, at least with the hollandaise!

Pros:
The ambiance is nice, great for a bridal shower or baby shower! The O'Brien style potatoes were really tasty! A little on the salty side but overall very yummy. I also had a caramel latte and it was delish!! The service was attentive and kind. I will say their up-selling could use a little work. They came on a bit too strong and insincere with trying to add avocado to everything!

My husband had the croque madame sandwich which was just OK. There was an  undesirable fragrance (of cleaning agents) upon entering,  and he says he could actually taste it in his sandwich.

Came this Monday afternoon and ordered the vegan Mac n cheese and chocolate mint ball dessert (I don't remember the name), per the cashier's recommendations. 

The food: The Mac n cheese was not well rounded as a dish, although I can't fault it for that--no one should know it as a well rounded nutritious dish. But even for the simple comfort food it's supposed to be, it was a chore to finish. A small part of the bowl was savory and tasty, but the rest was somewhat bland while tasting a bit like burnt nuts. It was crisp, but dry on top and the texture was watery in some areas while others were fine.

The chocolate mint ball doesn't taste like a dessert. It's not very sweet, although I'm sure many would like that. For its texture, its nutty composition makes it kind of dry and sandy.

The service: The cashier didn't make much eye contact and seemed rush to finish her job. She was also on the phone for a minute or two as I waited to order the dessert. That's not something I normally care about, but taken as a whole, it was crappy service.

The environment: One room seems a bit homely, while the dining area felt drab and uninspired. Could definitely use some more soul.

As of now, I can't recommend the place for either its food, desserts, service, or environment. However, it seems mainly marketed for its smoothies, and I didn't try those. I might try its smoothies or acai bowls in the future, but I'm about done with the food.",2019-08-12 22:05:44

I am a sucker for outdoor seating and this place definitely has it. The whole ""Danish bakery"" name and dollhouse-inspired inside decor would trick one into thinking it could be a great, authentic bakery; but it couldn't be further from anything remotely resembling a bakery. The first time I came here I just got a napoleon pastry, and it had jelly in it. WHAT? Call me amateur, call me ignorant, or call me knowing my damn pastries! Growing up in NJ, which is land of the I-talians, I have never eaten this type of pastry with jelly in it. Maybe its a Danish thing? Besides the jelly, the pastry layers were dull, not crispy, and the whole thing just sucked. So I thought maybe I just didn't appreciate their ""version"" of a napolean and after finishing up at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art I was craving a cappuccino. I walked by Anderson's and was once again lured by the outdoor seating on a pretty nice day. I went inside and saw a legit looking espresso machine (yes I checked leary from my last experience at this place) and spotted a choco cheesecake petit four in the case. Perfect combo, I thought. My cappuccino arrives and it has cinnamon on it. Really? Maybe that's a Danish thing too?  And apparently, so is drinking hot milk. Maybe its my fault for not cutting the bullshit and getting an espresso, but PURE MILK? I separated the foam from the milk to see my drink was almost white in color. So pissed. I already have to sike myself out of remembering cappuccinos are made with milk and this was borderline nauseating. I can't be certain there was even any espresso in it, because I specifically asked for 2 shots. My petit four was ok. The graham cracker at the bottom tasted stale like it was sitting there for 5 weeks and I really had to search and concentrate to find the flavor. Oh yeah, both of these items, $8. The only saving grace was the young kid server who was pleasant. So, sorry to say this place sucks and for me, its two strikes (not three) and you're out!",2012-01-25 06:03:13

I have high standards coming from the Portland restaurant scene.  So, I thought that maybe the burnt latte was just a fluke.  The homemade vanilla syrup had nice flavor, but unfortunately the latte espresso was quite burnt.  It had a cute little face as latte art, though!

Next, my husband could not eat the french toast, it was so hard.  I get that challah bread is hard, but when he couldn't saw through, that's saying something.  

My omelette was super greasy.  I mean grease oozing out.  I don't think it was cooked that well either as the cheese wasn't melted.  And, I'm not sure, but I think they forgot the cheddar cheese - even though they said it was white like the gruyere. 

The home potatoes were pretty hard and seemed old.  They didn't have much flavor either.  Definitely not worth the price for anything we ordered.  

Their homemade toast was pretty good - not amazing, but good with their jam.  

Because we both couldn't eat our food, they ultimately brought out our dishes a second time.  They were a bit better - the French toast could be eaten easier (at least with a steak knife which was provided with it on Take 2), and the omelette cheese was more melted.  Instead of pure grease on the omelette, it was mostly mushroom juices oozing out - still a no-no for omelettes.  My toast on my second plate was only toasted on one side - and not at all toasted on the underside.  The potatoes still tasted old and chewy.  Bleh.  

We were told the chef was brand new and having a rough adjustment.  I hope they get that ironed out as the restaurant has a lot of promise - great location, friendly staff, and a nice owner (at least, we think our primary server was the owner as she waived the cost of our meal, went back to help the chef at one point, and gave us some free pastries for the road - which were tasty).

I would give it another try, but I would inquire about the chef and his experience first.  I would also request that an experienced barista brew my espresso.  The best part of the meal was the fresh squeezed orange juice - expensive, but AMAZING!  I love fresh squeezed OJ.  But, they really do need to get the food quality way up - especially with such high prices.

We ended up here mostly because the patio looked very inviting.

I ordered the Scandinavian Duck and she ordered the Vol au Vent (sorta a crab salad, cake thing with hollandaise sauce). I don't normally order duck so I thought it would be interesting. It came with a port wine reduction sauce that was really delicious. The Duck was cooked well and it had some veggies on the side. It was a light lunch item that was enjoyable but I would probably try something else next time judging by what others around us were ordering.

My girlfriend's order was good, but kinda surprising. She ordered the Vol au Vent from the 'The Hot Kitchen' items on the menu. Unfortunately the dish is actually served cold. She said it was good, but when you are ordering something from a hot kitchen menu, we expected it to be hot or at least warm.

We each had mimosas that were very delicious and generous. We wanted the fruit mimosa but they were out of cranberry juice on a Saturday.

Staff and service was good. My only suggestion would be to sweep the ground once in a while or pick up trash around the patio tables where we were sitting.

Overall an okay experience, but with so many other restaurants in the area it is unlikely we will go back any time soon.",2016-06-11 16:57:26

However, I think the customer service could use a little help. I stop by the Santa Barbara location about once a week to get a gluten free cupcake which are always hit or miss like an actual recipe is not used. Sometimes they crumble apart and sometimes they're super dense and heavy. The Crushcake flavor is usually the best, especially when they get the texture right. So, a week ago I went in with my mother and bought 6 cupcakes- 2 of the gluten free (vanilla flavor) and 4 regular cupcakes for family. My mother and I sit down to have one and I take a bite of the vanilla gluten free and it has this horrible mint flavor to it. Like someone dumped in mint instead of vanilla. It was so gross that I couldn't eat it and I had instant regrets for buying two. I had my mother taste it and she agreed that it was awful and they must have messed up the recipe. She suggested I go get a refund so I went to the counter and explained to the girl working the situation with the gluten free flavor of the day....that it was really a weird mint flavor AND she argued with me! I couldn't believe it! She said ""some people just don't like the flavor of them"". Even after I said, ""No, i've had the vanilla flavor (and all the others!) and this is not vanilla...can I at least get a refund on the one still in the box untouched that hadn't even left the building?"". She said, ""No, I can't do that but I can trade it for one of the others"". Of course, this made me mad because I obviously can't have any of the other flavors! People with Celiac Disease don't get to just have one of the non-gluten free options instead. 

My suggestions if you are gluten free and like to indulge in baked goods like the rest of the world:

-Call ahead and ask the flavor first (they only make the gluten free M,W,F,Sat) and the best flavor is the crushcake flavor (red velvet w/ vanilla icing). 

-Don't buy more than one without tasting them first...",2011-12-28 04:18:32

Pros: The quiche my wife ordered was perfectly moist and the hearty strip of crispy bacon placed on top was delicious.  The accompanying salad with the honey mustard dressing made for a light lunch.  The homemade sausage was drenched in sauce but still was good.  The roasted red potatoes were just so-so but the sweet apples were good.  The outdoor tables and ""people-watching"" view were fun.

Cons: The French Onion soup barely had any cheese on top and was a little too salty.  Some of the outdoor tables for two are cramped so choose the tables meant for four.

On a positive note, the food, be it the sandwich cookies we bought and the breakfast items...which they also have a large selection, were very good. If I was rating on the quality of the food, this place would be a 4 to 4 1/2 star place. I also thought the guy who was working the register for the bakery items was very friendly and attentive. It was obvious though he was relatively new, but he did his best and we appreciated that.

That's where the positives end. The 4 cookie sandwiches we ordered coast $28, which was ridiculously over priced. I wanted to pay with cash, but I was forced to pay with credit card since they didn't have enough change..also ridiculous, not that it matters much...I was just trying to clear my wallet a bit.

However, the breakfast service was atrocious. First, we waited quite a long time for someone to clean the table, as there was only one table open on the patio. When the guy came to clean the table, he at first tried to save the table cloth by just flipping it over, but when he saw the other side was also dirty, he took it off exposes a table cloth underneath that draped off the side. He replaced the top cloth, but left the one draping on the side onto our legs which was still dirty. 

Then our food was delivered, but we had no napkins or utensils. I asked the waitress, who by the way took forever to take our order while a table next to us who came after us had already ordered 5-10 minutes earlier, for the napkins and utensils and we waited and waited while our food sat, but nothing. So I went into the restaurant, asked a man for help, he said he would take care of it, we waited another couple of minutes, then I asked a third person, they were about to bring it when finally person #2 brought it over. 

Then our waitress while we were only 3/4 done with our food brought the check without asking us if we wanted anything else. 

The whole experience from a service perspective was a case study in disaster. We decided we wouldn't be coming back. Highly recommend Lilac across the street instead. They should give lessons to Anderson for service.",2019-08-26 01:35:51

My mom ordered a fruit plate which costs $10, but there was a lot of fruit, enough to be shared for 4. My dad ordered a $6 cup of milk which in my opinion is a lot for a glass unless it is Raw Organic Whole Milk. The omelets were $16 which is a fair price is whole, farm fresh, and organic ingredients are being used. Both omelets that were ordered were unexplainably greasy; so much grease my toast had soaked up a lot of it. And the toast was cold!! Now being a bakery, I expect a lot more from the bread.

My fiance, her father and I came to this restaurant to begin a celebratory wine tasting adventure after our engagement less than 12 hours prior. While my fiance was finishing her brunch, a bottle of red wine fell behind her, almost hitting her head. There was red wine and glass EVERYWHERE. It had even reached the next table. I was so thankful that my fiance was ok. The manager came over to apologize and see if anyone was hurt, which felt nice. However, the server who was charged with cleaning up the mess seemed annoyed each time either we or the neighboring table pointed out there was glass he missed. When he was ""done"" cleaning up the glass, there was still glass under my feet and under a different table. To add insult to injury, another wine bottle was placed in the same location where the original fell--it was being used to prop up a picture that slid and pushed the bottle over. So, the manager's gesture of ""checking-in"" didn't seem to align with a motive of caring about our safety.

When the bottle spilled, it stained an umbrella that my fiance had used for the first time. Normally, we wouldn't care about the umbrella, but it had sentimental value as it was a part of a gift/package that my fiance gave me the first time she said, ""I love you."" We thought that this would be a beautiful time to use it. However, it is now covered in red wine stains.

Ever order a crab salad sandwich for over $16 and get less than 2 oz of crab? We did. My wife and I ordered 2 for lunch that come with tomato, avocado, lettuce & sprouts. This is the coast of California and Dungeness crab is in season so it should be great. , but the waitress revealed they used ALASKAN KING ( much more expensive and not fresh, than Dungeness!!) My wife's had about 1 oz of crab and no avocado. Mine had about 1.6 oz of crab. Both were overly sweet because ......THEY ADDED SUGAR!!!! Ridiculous?! Absolutely! 

Needless to say the lettuce, sprouts, etc... vastly outnumbered and overpowered the taste of the crab, what little there was. Then, what little taste was left was killed by the SUGAR!  

The waitress came out and asked us ""where was the crab"" on the plate my wife sent back after one bite. We politely told her that we were wondering the same thing and that was why we'd sent it back. I'd only eaten mine because I was very hungry, but if I'd known it contained SUGAR I wouldn't have touched it. 

As a chef and former restaurant owner, I know chefs add sugar to mask inferior ingredients and/or quality in main course meals. Sugar ruins quality dishes and also is bad for health. It should never be done at a good restaurant. I understand this is a bakery, but really?!!

To her credit, the waitress did not charge us for our meal. But she also told us that the Danes routinely add sugar to many main courses. Well, we get to Denmark often, have many Danish friends, and often eat at their homes and at Danish restaurants. Our experience has been NO SUGAR in main courses. Even so, there was no excuse for some little and such poor quality crab when less expensive quality ingredients are in abundant supply!

We tipped $5 and left. Avoid the crab sandwich",2017-11-07 22:03:53

Since I am not familiar with the area I thought I would look for a bakery near by on yelp. When I saw the pictures I was impressed and thought wow great I found the place. When I called the woman had a thick French accent and I thought it was, adorable since it's a French bakery will let me tell you the cake was not at all to the standards I thought it would be. I spend a bit of money on the cake. The cake looked unfinished and it looked like it was done sloppy. There was no decorations of flowers on the cake when I had asked for that. It was so bad I didn't take a picture. I was so disappointed that I will never order again from here. If you have a different baker let us know or put recents pictures of your work. I even went to the website and told her which one I liked and it looked like a teenager baked it. Even my husband thought it was a waste of money.",2018-10-09 00:02:53

The coffee was good and enjoyed sitting in the restaurant   It is a nice place.  
Cashier was nice, Bus boy not very friendly but did his job ok. They should sweep up after the breakfast rush though.  
Eggs Benedict was just ok. Small portion. The price doesn't match what I got.  
Egg was cooked nicely with runny yolk and the bread was ok but the dish is not memorable.  
I was very disappointed they didn't have potatoes.  They said they ran out. I arrived around 11:45 AM. 
I really wanted potatoes.  I got the salad instead. 
I wish they had a vegetarian eggs Benedict.  
It came with ham. I would have like to substitute avocado. 
Maybe I should have asked but forgot. 

The Vege quiche was not very good and small, perhaps because I am comparing it to the last quiche I ate which was at Dominique Ansel's bakery in Los Angeles which is top notch but still the quiche tasted like microwaved eggs on a crust. 

By the way I would have tried the French Toast but I refuse to pay over 12 dollars for 2 pieces of bread. They should have at least 4 pieces of French toast. 


The choc croissant was not bad and the choc chip cookie was good.

The food was good but it took a very long time for our food to be served and for the dishes to be removed after lunch. The crab salad sandwich is definitely not meant to be eaten as a sandwich.

I asked the owner about the macaroons that are almost always kept in the freezer in the back. Well, they were out of them and I was told in a brusque manner that there weren't any and ""You''ll live"". You'll live???? Wow. I went to the counter to get some other pastries to go anyway and asked about the price of one and was told $1.95. I ordered 2 of those and 1 more pastry. Then after all was boxed, the bill was much more then I had anticipated.  I was told the cookies were really $3.95 each. Well, I didn't have enough money.

Regardless of how awesome you are, I hope you would understand that planning a wedding is stressful(!) and couples are all trying to look for vendors that can make their lives easier, the big day magical, and for you to pull it off with the stress on your backend.

My experience was pleasant with Leah, she responded promptly and tried to fit us in last-minute. We have been very busy planning this destination wedding 3-hours away from the SB location. I felt bad to try to see if we could be accommodated last minute for our trip to SB tomorrow afternoon from LA, but yanno planning escapes every bride and groom and sometimes you gotta see if you can try out some cakes in the midst of fitting in all your other tasks to find a rehearsal dinner spot, find a florist, etc. I digress.

Anyways, the first gal who answered the phone was very pleasant, chipper, and cheerful. I was happy to be calling Chooket! :) But after being transferred to her supervisor who had more details, this lady tried to shame me for not booking my appointment by 4pm. She spoke to me in this condescending tone which implied, ""We do not need your business. You need us and I'll make sure you follow our rules."" I requested if there's any way she could fit us in and was sorry that the day got away from us but there were only a couple trips more we had planned to head to SB and wished she could fit us in. It's my first time ordering a wedding cake so I had a good amount of questions in regards to the sizes, sheet cakes, etc. and she talked to me in this tone which said ""you're dumb you don't know these things."" As much as I feel like I would need to go with Chooket since said lady on the phone made it sound like wedding cakes will be sold out if I don't order 3-months before and they are all already booked for business almost, I just need to inform other stressed brides not to call this place to ask questions or go here for your wedding cake. It's not pleasant or fun! I had to share this experience with my groom and now two of us are not happy campers.

Chooket (or sorry rather, gal on the phone), I'm sorry your customer is not as important as letting us know how high in demand and sold out you are as a bakery, there's just no time to fit us in. Also, the gal on the phone told us she would only be serving us the leftovers since we didn't make an appointment in time. Way to make us feel bad. To this my groom responded, then why are we paying for leftovers? Yes, that's what she called your cake tasting, the leftovers, that we would be fed.

Hmmm I did not have this experience with another cake vendor I called who was so happy and kind, the manager spent 30-minutes on the phone with me and did not stress SOS sign me to order ASAP knowing brides have a million other items to get done. That's why I know there was something wrong with that other gal I spoke with on the phone. It seemed like some passive aggressive thing going on with her and she does not like her job one bit!

My guests were laughing at how awful it looked and I was in tears over it. I was so excited to have the cake of my dreams and had the complete opposite. Crushcakes gave me a 95$ refund and a 50$ gift card to their store. However, considering the cake(which was over $400) was the completely wrong color, falling apart, had glitter on it, and had barely any marbling on it I think a larger refund would have been appropriate. Attached are the pictures I showed Crushcakes of how I wanted my cake to look and the pictures of what my cake ended up looking like.

The employee that assisted us, a brunette girl, early 20's with long straight hair, approximately 5'6""-5'7"" and thin, had the worst attitude I have seen in a long time. 

I saw a family walking away in disgust as we just walked into the bakery and noticed that family was dealing with the employee I am referring to. Not knowing the back story with that family and why they were upset, I dismissed it and began to proceed with our selections. 

As I inquired about a drink that contained ice cream, the employee rudely told us they were out of ice cream. My daughter than Asked the employee if their iced coffee contained any favoring. The employee responded by telling us ""I said we were out of ice cream"". With a confused look on my daughter's face, she looked at me then told the employee, ""never mind"". As my wife made her selections, employee seemed upset as my wife either added, subtracted or changed her mind on several baked goods. My wife looked at me, shook her head and told me she was going to wait outside. As I began to look for my selections, the employee asked, ""is that all?"" Feeling rushed and already upset with the employee, I said, ""yes"" and she then told me, ""meet me at the register!"" 

Prior to walking towards the register, a mere 3 feet, I noticed they had eclairs, which is what one of my other daughters wanted. As I began to look at the eclairs, the employee said, ""SIR!"". I responded to her, ""just wait a second!"". When she copped that attitude with me, I said to  myself, ""screw this"" and if it wasn't Mother's Day that day, I would have tossed all the items I had already selected on the counter and walked out. 

Her attitude and lack of professionalism was inexcusable. For it being Mother's Day, it was not busy and even if it had been, still...NO EXCUSE!!.

The pastries is what you want to come here for! They have the best almond croissants in town. I have yet to try the other pastries but they are beautifully displayed and I'm sure well worth the purchase.

I started with the cream of broccoli soup and had the Schnitzel for dinner... I have most def had better. it was very bland and it was good to try... but deff not to ever get again.  It came with veggies and I got mine with mashed potatoes... the veggies and potatoes were the best part.
My dad had split pea and the special of the day was pork roast.
Dad's split pea was not very good... it was overpowered by basil... and my poor father hates basil SO he was very unhappy bc ... well who puts basil in SPLIT PEA? weird. 
Also his meat was tender... very fatty... and seemed like they added too much spice.

There may not have been many people here eating... HOWEVER it seemed like every 10 minutes people were coming in for the baked goods!  
This place seems to be a better breakfast/lunch/ bakery kinda place.
We are planning on coming back for the bakery next time we are up.
I gave the place a 3 because it has great potential for the other things it offers.

service was great and polite.",2010-10-19 03:31:51

I ordered strawberries with fresh whipped cream.

They offered to bring me something else but I didn't want to waste more time. I think they thought I wouldn't notice...? Btw, it's a bakery. How do you not have cream? 

My kids got the eggs and pancake plate. Took them three years to bring it. My 4-year old son was the last to get his plate of eggs because they messed up the order in the kitchen. Seems disorganized. The eggs tasted ok and the side of pancakes too. But he's 4 and hungry so we got lucky he didn't flip out. 

Note they only have one bathroom. My son likes to take his time so I guess while we were in there three people peed their pants waiting for us. Awk. 

I also ordered a slice of the princess cake. I'm from Sweden so I was excited to eat it. However, it did not taste authentic. It's an ok cake but it did not taste like a princess cake. 

When you first arrive they give you a pastry for the table. It was like an almond chocolate danish. Nice touch. It was good but we got one for a table of 5. Maybe if they had cut it and presented it differently it would have seemed like more...? Idk.

You see the problem they had with the cake
Was simply the icing...
and this is where things got twisted

They used a regular white icing, (no detection of much butter cream) 
And that's when my friends reminded me

""Where is the cream cheese icing ?""
The room got silent....
And thats when my tastebuds gave up...

They served red velvet cake with no cream cheese icing beefed it up with filler...

Looking at the table 
A1/4 of the cake had been sampled 
While the rest of it remained untouched 

The star of the show not only disappointed 
But also gave us a reason to cancel thoughts of another try.

They could have at least warned us that the cake isn't the same as the cupcake. And offered options...

3. Staff with lousy attitude and a product you can get elsewhere. 

Lokum falls in the last category. If you are craving for a dessert late in the evening, you could go there as they are open late. The lokums and baklava weren't too bad but the pistachio in lokum was bit rancid.

I was not a fan of the flavor of the veggie wrap, and I found the avocado toast to be exceptionally overpriced.

I purchased an assortment of marzipan bakery items. I believe three or four products. They were average at best. The texture was off and the marzipan did not mesh well with the rest of the ingredients. Lastly,  they were expensive compared to all places I have had marzipan at in recent years.

Andersen's provides a cute European high tea, brunch, or lunch experience. The variety of colorful pastries and sweets gets me every time. At one point, the prices were astronomical for what they provided - all the desserts tasted the same due to the signature whipped cream fluff found in everything. I left feeling cheated every time because somehow fluff for dessert along with an average brand of tea cost more than eating a main course at Carlitos. 

There are wonderful Patisseries and coffee shops in town but for New Years Eve, my husband and I wanted to celebrate and reminisce at Andersen's. You know, for old times sake...even knowing we were paying for overpriced fluff. Bad idea. 

The ladies working were bitter and mean. The service was so slow (half hour waiting at a table), so I went to the counter to order a pastry to go. The lady yelled at me, ""Sit Down!"" Confused, I asked if she was talking to me and she said, ""Yes! Someone will get your order. Sit down!"" I hadn't felt this way since elementary school. So I sat down. The table next to me was equally frustrated and were also surprised that I was told to sit down. So sitting was what I did. Sitting is what they did. Everyone was afraid to move a muscle for the fear of not getting white fluff on NYE.

Besides the terribly slow service, there was a lot of  passive aggressive anger from the waitress, probably because she was forced to work on NYE. We were treated like a canker sore. 

The scary thing is, another employee gave us someone else's credit card. We refused to sign and told her that the card wasn't ours. She took it back and walked away. 

We were ready to go after the foul mood and frantic energy. We had our pastry and wanted to leave. So we asked for the bill. Well, within the distance of 10 feet, the waitress managed to lose my husband's credit card. After looking around frantically for it, (it was hidden on the counter under some other items), the ladies behind the counter didn't want to give him his card back. They accused him of taking the stranger's credit card, and that somehow, his card couldn't possibly be his. He said his name and described the card and they were still very hesitant. They asked what he did with the other one. ???

Yay, we finally got our card back after a tug of war, but we had never received our drinks yet. So we just left without receiving our drinks, paying for an evening of frantic confusion and anger from the staff. This was not how I wanted to ring in 2020. The sad thing is, the place wasn't packed. 

The good thing is, they've improved on the pastries 100%. Gone is that white fluff stuffed in everything and now they actually have tasty, rich desserts. 

We are not sure if we will return. If I'm in a reminiscing mood, perhaps we will some day. 

Just some word of advice: don't go on a holiday or a weekend to avoid the tourists and the understaffed cray cray. This place has room for so much potential, I hope it turns into a SB gem someday.",2020-01-07 03:37:06

I was back and forth on Anderson's Danish Bakery & Restaurant and the Hungry Cat.  Both looked good for different reasons.

I went ahead and made reservations at the Hungry Cat.  The reviews were just too good.  Well, turns out we got an early start leaving the humble hamlet of Reseda and pulled into SB at 9:30 a.m.  Shit!  We're early!  Now what?  We're hungry and there's wine to be tasted up North!

The HC isn't open until 10:30 a.m. so we decided to go to Anderson's.  The place is nice, right on State with outdoor patio seating which looked inviting.  Our server was sweet and did a good job.

Wanted a Bloody Mary, but they don't have hard booze so that's not going to happen.  Went with a glass of champagne.  Pleasant!

Scanned the menu and went with:
Eggs Benedict Napoleons. Topped with Danish ham, poached eggs, and creamy hollandaise. $12.95.

It looked good when it arrived, but as I tucked into it,  I did not like it at all.  The puff pastry is a nice idea, but an English muffin is the superior vessel for a proper eggs benedict.  

That aside, on top of said puff pastry was some unadvertised things such as melted dill havarti cheese and a thick slice of tomato under the ham.  These items were most unwelcome on my plate.  

I know I read the menu online and there was no mention of these wacky ingredients.  Perhaps they were on the menu at the restaurant in the fine print.  Must have missed them if they were.  Eggs were on the brink of being over cooked, no runny goodness!  The hollandaise was far too lemony.  

All these ingredients mixed together did not work.  The tomato was tangy as was the hollandaise sauce.  Then the dill havarti came in there and my taste buds were saying WTF dude?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g?select=FTCnRsoBuJBBkAiSkWcPjA

I ordered the Fried Egg Sandwich, cafe latte and almond croissant. The bf ordered a three egg omelette with ham, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes. We flashed our axxess card and the woman who took our order didn't even check for the stamp promotion- we haven't been here before and we vaguely heard that the stamp would give us 50% off. Rather than recharging us the correct amount with this deal, she just gave us 10% and told us ""next time"". To me, this really gave a sour taste in my mouth. I know that the customer isn't always correct, but don't tell me ""next time"" when I flash my axxess card (and btw, they have signs in the front about the axxess deal). She didn't know how to run the order with the deal, but she also had another woman helping her (which is weird because obviously she wasn't helpful enough to resolve this ""issue""). I would rate this restaurant 1 star off service alone, but I won't do that. However, I'm taking off 2 stars.

The fried egg sammie was really yummy- buttery brioche, crunchy (crisp? healthy? fresh?) tomatoes, bacon, and yummy yummy cheese. So good. I ordered the salad as a side and I don't regret it! Tangy dressing and it wasn't all soggy!

The almond croissant was a joy. So buttery and flaky. People weren't kidding about this. I'm on a healthy kick so I'm lowering my carb intake, but mannnnn, those croissants are excellent. Oh, the homemade jam is also so yummy. Tangy, sweet, and just really vibrant.

Would come back here, but would totally avoid the woman who took our order- she was very unpleasant.",2017-03-10 20:37:56

This place seemed popular and looked interesting so we decided to give it a shot.  That was a mistake...
While the menu had a nice spread of options, it took over twenty minutes for us to get a server to take our drink order. This first impression didn't sit well with us, but we knew the rush was ending so we decided to let it go and enjoy our time there. 
Soon enough, we had to flag down a server to take our order.
About 10 minutes later a different server walked over and dropped off a plate of what looked like half eaten food (sort of like a bread plate but it wasn't). There were literally two pieces of pie, a few pieces of old bread, sticks of butter and crumbs all over the plate. It honestly looked as if the server had removed it from a table who didn't finish it and left it with us...disgusting!
When the food that we actually ordered came out, I sent that left over plate away. Our food was pretty good and that is why this post isn't getting a one star rating.  However, the service never got any better, in fact it got worse. Never once during our meal did a server come ask us how our food was or if we wanted more drinks, we even had to flag someone down for the bill so we could leave.  
Overall it was a waste of time and money. There are so many more great places to eat around here, pass on this one.",2014-06-07 22:13:47

There are 3 different seating areas with 1 outside and 2 different rooms indoors. We were seated near the window but I didn't like that they were high tables. The silverware and the table cloth were a bit dirty.

I ordered the croissant french toast and my friend ordered an omelet. Both were decent tasting and okay but were pretty overpriced. My croissant french toast was pretty small- 2 little croissants cut in half to make 4 slices. It was pretty delicious but nothing special and the portion was too small to make it worth it. The omelet was average as well and the potatoes weren't very flavorful. Overall, the food was decent but definitely not worth the price tag.",2017-02-27 19:34:29

If your team told you they offered a substitute, it's not true. The lady actually told us we couldn't substitute because of the pandemic.

My wife and I came to SB for a 5 day vacation and this was by far the worst place we tried for breakfast.  If you are looking for just baked goods, it might not be bad (we didn't try those). As a breakfast option, we'll below average.

Pros
- Interior is incredibly cute (although closed for the pandemic)
- People were friendly

Cons
- Overpriced especially considering the portion size. They charged $16 for the kielbasa plate. It was a few slices of kielbasa, some potatoes, 1 slice of bacon and a tiny side cup of stewed apples. My wife eats like a bird and she finished it no problem.
- Service was really slow and not attentive (latte came out 10 minutes after meal, took forever to bring out ketchup for potatoes)
- Potato's were absolutely disgusting. I think they put cumin on them. They literally tasted like they were out of an Indian restaurant. I like Indian good but not at a Danish bakery.

Last week I had placed an order for thirty cupcakes for my bridal shower to be picked up on Friday, the day before. I had ordered the standard flavors, because I was told the special flavors required an order of at least a dozen. At about three Friday afternoon I recieved a call from them, they explained to me the ""baker made the wrong one's"" so they were unable to provide four of the flavors I ordered (two being chocolate and vanilla). They asked me ""so what do you want to do?"" I told them I still need thirty cupcakes, do what you have to. They were still able to provide 30 cupcakes, but their idea of making it right was giving me two extra cupcakes free of charge. 
I am frustrated because the point of me placing an order and paying in advance was to reserve the variety of flavors that I wanted. To me, they failed to pull the right flavors for my order. I don't understand how the ""baker made the wrong one's"" when all the flavors I ordered were their standard (I just want to reiterate, they didn't have the chocolate or vanilla I ordered).

So, that's when I came. The person taking the order was nice, but new, so when I asked a question about the food, she'd ask the manager who was a young girl sitting on a couch with a guy and who couldn't crack a smile if you paid her!

They brought it out to me in a to-go container and said that I wanted to eat it there, after which they reminded me that they close at 5.

I felt extremely rushed, didn't enjoy the toast at all because I was stuffing it down while they picked up my napkins and silverware and kept poking their head in the room where I was sitting!

All of the packaged cookies had a generic ingredients list on them which did not list spices. We ended up using the $5 ""gingerbread"" men as dog treats because nobody wanted to eat them. The stollen was also a huge disappointment. Perhaps a French bakery should not attempt a traditionally German recipe. The loaf was dry, light and fluffy with a smattering of fruit and raisins; the Wonderbread of stollens.

Also! We ordered the ""country wheat sourdough"" as our toast selection, and we LOVED it. I would come back just for toast and jam. We loved it so much we decided to get a loaf to take home.

I came in on President's Day 2020 (02/17/2020) with my siblings and couple of friends. They had just helped me move and some of them, it was their first time in SB. A few of them where craving coffee so I wanted to treat them to a coffee and a pastry.  I ordered 3 coffee's and 2 pastries. The bill was a little over 27. 

We got our coffee and pastries and sat down as a group. About 10 minutes later the guy that took my order comes by and apologizes about the wait on the ""other coffee"". I said what other coffee. I only order 3 and we have them here. He says ""Oh you have 3, I only charged you for 2!""

Wait a minute, you handed me the 3 coffees, you charged me, and you're the one that also thinks there's a 4th one on the way...how did we get to ""I only charged you for 2!"". If I had kept my mouth shut, not only would we had gotten a 4th coffee but it would have been free. My sincerity cost me. He said- ""just finish up and no rush, when you're done, just come by and pay for the 3rd coffee"" Yo, there's customers all around, you made the mistake and now I have to be embarrassed and get up to pay for your mistakes?

I didn't have a receipt to prove he did charged me, so I went up to him before leaving and said, I thought my bill was north of 27 dollars. He said ""yes, pastries and coffee are 5 dollars or so, so you still owe one more."" I was so tired from the moving and was so frustrated I went ahead and paid this invisible coffee. Let me tell you, they make great invisible coffee. The best in town, maybe the world.  

The next day, I revisited this when I looked at my slim bank account and thought- well 3 coffees is 15 dollars and I only got 2 pastries that should be about 25. I vaguely remember the bill being somewhere in the 27 something range. Meaning I didn't have to pay for another coffee. 

Bro, you were going to give me a 4th coffee and I ended up paying a hefty price for your mistakes of not keeping tabs on what your customers are asking for and paying. Disgraceful. 

Moral of the story- Don't go dressed as if you just moved, they will probably want you not to come back and hit you with some invisible coffee charges. And don't be so damn sincere, learn to keep your mouth shut maybe you can get a free coffee.",2020-02-20 18:20:47

So, the quick part, probably not entirely their fault.  I mean, it was Mother's Day.  I can't blame them for that.  We went around 10am and were seated about 15 minutes later.  Even though they were busy, it took way too long to get our food.  Maybe 30 minutes.  They did however, give us some scrumptious Danish pastries to munch on.  They gave us an apply pastry and some bread.  When the food finally came, it at least LOOKED good.  My wife had the typical egg breakfast, which was ok.  I had this sausage dish, which just tasted like a pork patty.  However, the tomato relish (or whatever it's called) was very tasty.  My daughter ordered waffles with whip cream and strawberries.  She didn't like them because there was a hint of lemon (which wasn't mentioned on the menu).  Being a daddy, I had to be the ""garbage disposal"" and eat them myself.  They weren't bad.

As for service, it was horrendous.  The waitresses (yes, we seemed to have 2 or 3) weren't mean, but were extremely in a hurry and made me feel uneasy.  They didn't have any high chairs available either.  How in the world is a family supposed to eat when they're holding their kids?!?  Also, they placed us at the top of the stairs near the pseudo kitchen/cleaning area.  Extremely uncleanly and also say the waitress grab food with their bare hands.

Would I come back?  Probably not.  For one, there are other restaurants I would try since I hardly come to Santa Barbara.  And two, this visit just left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively.  Although, their pastries looked and tasted good, I think I will save my Danish baked goods cravings for the many Solvang bakeries, which conveniently is located on the route back to the Bay Area.",2015-05-29 04:10:01

This past several weeks I went there twice and both times I was disgusted. Most recently, I was there two weeks ago to buy cupcakes for my neighbor.

It was so bad that she offered an excuse, unsolicited, that her allergies, we ""out of control""; I hope that was the case during this pandemic. The cupcakes (Cool Vanilla Bean, Chocolate Chocolate, and Black and White) were dry and the frosting was flavorless. Yesterday I went back to get a sandwich. My plan was to not order anything if that same employee there. She wasn't. I ordered the Tuna Albacore sandwich to go. When I got back to my office, I was disappointed yet again. I thought to myself 'how can anyone screw up a Tuna sandwich' .... but they did. There was tuna on only one half of the bread. The vegetables were old and wilted. The bread was stale and hard!

Same goes for their lunch menu; it's so hard to justify an average size kale salad for $11 plus tax & tip. 

Yes they have tons of fresh ingredients and love supporting local businesses but the prices are just too much for me these days unless the portions grow. I do love Intelligista coffee though and to treat myself to an overly sweet cupcake that has more frosting than a full on birthday cake, every so often so I will be back in for those.

If you are going to try Crushcakes for their food I'd recommend the Carpinteria location over this one because of their adorable back patio and somehow the food just seems to taste better there every time. Though this location seems to have more cupcakes on the daily. 

The parking here is all timed free street parking. It's located right near downtown and across from the Arlington theatre. They do have a small back patio with cute little red chairs and metal tables. And the service is nice but a little on the slower side for food prep, so not your best option if in a rush.

There were a total of two positive things about our lunch experience: 1) Our waiter was friendly and 2) the order came out correct.  Beyond that, everything was truly awful.  Waited for ten minutes to get drinks ordered, then the waiter forgot what we ordered (two glasses of water).  Finally brought the water and took our order.  Then it took almost 40 minutes to receive our food which was just a piece of quiche and BLT sandwich (the restaurant was not busy and there were plenty of staff who all seemed to be doing nothing).  To top things off, the waiter brought the sandwich fully five minutes before the quiche and both meals arrived room temperature, far from hot or fresh.  The quiche was dry, tasteless and burnt with a huge glob of cheese melted on top and a piece of bacon thrown on.  Far from an attractive presentation and certainly not worth the $13 charge. The sandwich was adequate, the fries terrible, and also not worth $15.  Overall, this was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.

The food is fine but certainly nothing close to Paris, which I am very familiar with. But as several other reviewers have noted the staff is seriously lacking. Today was the last straw with this bakery's staff for me and I won't be going back to any location again.

Several times at the location on Las Positas Road and State Street the staff, in particular a young man, put bakery business and training ahead of customer service.  Recently with a long line of customers waiting, he spent the time training a new employee rather than servicing customers. 

Today at the Gelsons location, I waited at the counter totally ignored by two employees behind the counter.  This is after I had to wait outside in the heat to get into the store.  When I asked if anyone was working the register a young woman attempted to serve me, but was stopped by a young man, I believe he is the same one, and I was told to wait a minute.  He was busy training her in cake decoration and I was considered secondary to this. I announced that training should be done when there were no customers waiting for service.   After a few minutes additional wait, very reluctantly, he waited on me and all but threw the croissants in a bag and pushed them at me, without closing the bag or a word of thanks.  

Really, am I asking too much?  Would this young man have a job without customers? I complained to the Gelsons store manager, who said that the bakery did not come under his jurisdiction, which I knew, but I told him it was a reflection on the Gelsons brand nonetheless.  He agreed and promised he would speak to the young man. 

With the marvelous new bakery at Bristol Farms just opening, I suggest the owners of Renauds improve their staff training and communicate the importance of excellent customer service to protect their business. 

Gelsons would do well to protect their image and insist on having some say and control over the Renauds employees, which could learn a great deal from the Gelsons employees.",2020-08-25 23:15:40

There was a range of goodies, including coconut macaroons, several types of Danish, and tarts. Not an extensive range, but a fair amount for a bakery/restaurant.

My low rating is due to the design. 
From the start I gave them a photo and said quote me to make this exact cake.  Along the way I kept re-iterating I want the cake to look like the photo (in case there was any staff turnover).  Right up to the month before our wedding, I submitted the same photo again as a reminder.  Come wedding day, they delivered a cake that didn't look very much like the photo.  The decorator took liberties and added LITERALLY DOUBLE the number of design elements on the outside. And our cake design was very simple, it wasn't anything elaborate that needed special equipment.  The end result was much busier and cluttered than what we asked for.  

I think we can all agree the design of a wedding cake is very important.  We don't pay that much for merely a tasty piece of cake - it's about the appearance.  Considering this is the most expensive dessert of your life, they should follow your instructions or reach out to discuss why they cannot and come up with a solution.  They did not.  They had no explanation when I asked them and showed them the side by side photo comparison. Their decorator simply didn't follow my instructions and they had no response as to why. 

If looks don't matter, then hire them.  If you have a specific look you want, be careful - they don't follow instructions and they don't do anything after the fact to apologize for it. You're stuck with what they give you - hope it looks good in your wedding photos!",2021-06-17 19:40:46

I was pleasantly shocked at the price for one 8"" cake and one 3-tier cake, especially considering that Crush Cakes has been featured on Food Network and various publications. The affordability of this cake compensates for its presentation not being up to my standards.

Upon arrival, the cake was slightly tilted to one side. Worst yet (& this peeved me most), they put the ROUND cake on a SQUARE base even though I told them the cake would be displayed on a round silver cake stand. When they delivered the cake, the Crush Cakes employees clearly did not look at what they were doing and think, ""Gee, we should probably remove this square base before putting the cake on display."" I don't know, maybe that's just me, but that detail is kind of important and kind of sticks out like a sore thumb! 

My husband & I (long-time fans of Crush Cakes' cupcakes & café) loved the frosting and detailing, but now hate showing people the pictures of the cake because of the awkward-as-hell SQUARE piece of foil-covered cardboard stuck between the beautiful cake and beautiful silver stand. And I'm bummed because my hopes of our wedding (& the cake specifically) being featured in wedding publications & blogs (which my photographer & I are applying to now) is shot. So much for that idea. 

Also, Crush Cakes did not call me to confirm any details the week before the wedding: I had to call them. While my other wedding vendors were very on-top of it from a communications standpoint, Crush Cakes was pretty M.I.A. Another aspect they need improvement on when it comes to their wedding cake department.

All in all, things could have been much worse, I'm sure! The cake tasted delicious and that's probably all that mattered to the guests.

I only asked because she had asked someone else in front of us who also ordered chocolate croissants to see if they would like them warm, so it's not like it was a ridiculous request.

What is this whole pre - tipping thing that is being put in your face before you being served your food and/or provided any service whatsoever.
I pre-tipped 18% which is very generous in my opinion. If I knew how much we would dislike our meal I wouldn't tip a single $1. 
I asked for an extra avocado to my vegetarian omelette, for an extra charge of course, but somehow it also got added to my husband's French dip that came out with TOAST instead of French baguette and when we asked the waitress how come our friend has a French baguette with his French dip and we have a toast she said that ""it depends who took your order"".

So I ordered one of them, which had smoked salmon, Havarti cheese, capers, onions, with their famous dill sauce built on top of toast points.  It was terrible.  It just was.  I am a smoked fish aficionado, and this was just ""okay,"" but when you add their ""famous"" dill sauce, which was SWEET, it became awful.  The fish was nothing spectacular on its own, but the sauce killed it for me.  Not my cup o' tea........ I don't want anything sweet coming near my salmon, smoked or otherwise.  The toast points weren't working for me, either.

He ordered Charlotte's Salad, which was a pile of mixed greens that was supposed to come with fresh seasonal fruit, dried cranberries, and blue cheese, mixed with herbal balsamic dressing.  If you could find the fruit, let us know, because neither of us could find hardly any amid all that lettuce.  Hardly any bleu cheese either.  He didn't even want them to fix it...... we both were very put off by our lunches. 

However, this, of course, did not deter me from sauntering inside to buy some of their bakery items...... if anything, I had justified a ""reward"" for having to put up with a disappointing lunch.  The bakery display was huge, and everything looked quite good.  I was a bit concerned, not gonna lie, that they weren't going to taste good after the lunches we had...... just look good.  So the verdict is that the bakery items were better than the lunch, but they weren't THAT good.  Just okay.... and definitely not worth the calories that were consumed trying them.

Update your website.  This is pathetic.  False advertising is foul...you know this.  

Other than that, the eggs are VERY soft and creamy, and the brioche bun is all shiny and super buttery.

It could have been one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had thus far in life (Egg Tuck in LA is very close), but the embarrassment of it all...

Not sure if I'll be back.  

To the owner:  it doesn't matter even if you must raise your prices...cause for many of us, money is no option when it comes to a good dining experience.  But don't nickel and dime people.  Don't sell a good dining experience short.  People make time out of their day to support your business, so make sure it's the best possible experience.  We could have gone anywhere else, but we supported you.  If the website says items come with a certain meal, it should be honored.

The place was fairly busy on a Saturday morning, so we had to be vigilant in finding a spot to sit after ordering our drinks and breakfast sandwiches. I had a double espresso and my girlfriend a cappuccino; Handlebar provided the coffee beans. 

We went for the Brioche, or should I say Bree'osh, breakfast sandwiches. One with Salmon and the other Egg, Cheese, and add ham. 

We set down outside at a table that still had some dishes on it. When the waitress brought out our drinks, she cleaned the table, but didn't wipe it leaving behind all kinds of things. When the food came out, they brought the utensils, but not the napkins. I know, I sound really snooty here, but put yourself in my shoes. These are basic things that don't take more time. 

My espresso was super strong, citrusy, and earthy. While the cappuccino, was good, I could not taste the actual coffee. Everything just tasted like milk.

The eggs in the sandwiches were fine, but severely under seasoned, as was the side salad. The texture was like a soft omelet, not a scrambled. The cheese in the eggs didn't add anything to the taste of the dish, but both the salmon and ham were quite good. The salmon also had a nice amount of pepper and lemon.

------------------------------------------------------
To Whom It May Concern,

My Mother's Day experience at The Andersen's Bakery in Downtown Santa Barbara was terribly disappointing.  On the Friday morning, prior to Mother's Day, I called and received confirmation that I could come to the restaurant and order food for take-out.  Your website also confirmed that orders were available for takeout on Mother's Day.  I had a brunch setup at my home with people waiting for their food and pastries.  After waiting in line and getting to the register I was informed that they were not able to offer take-out.  I was shocked, disappointed and embarrassed by this.  I explained I had already confirmed and that people were waiting at my home.  I pleaded that there must be something we could do.  The two cashiers were rather rude and one stated - ""sure, you can eat here!"".  This was not the answer or that attitude I needed or deserved.

As a lifetime local and longtime patron of your business, I hope this does not fall on blind eyes.  Thankfully, Renaud's rescued my brunch with amazing food and pastries.  My guests exclaimed that you actually did us a favor by refusing my business.

I hope other patrons were not also put into this situation and that you can work to better serve and communicate in the future.  These are very trying times and I would think that every customer is valuable to you in the long run.

Thanks,
Christopher

Historically, the food and pastries are great!  Two stars for that...  This experience and non-response is inexcusable.  A simple apology and ""Please give us another chance"" would have been wonderful!

Yet the line is not moving cause all the store employees were chatting with the first customer and holding up the line. I thought okay at least I'm not in a hurry and I can wait. Finally they were done talking with the first customer and line started to move quickly. This is when things got a bit interesting.

I ordered my ice cream sandwich as quickly as possible cause I don't want spend more time in a unpleasant place like this.  And to add on top of my experience, they do not take cash. There is no sign in or outside of the store mentioning it all all and I had to run outside to get my credit card from husband. Again I understand businesses where they don not take cash for sanitation but this was after she saw I had cash in my hand this whole time. It almost felt like she was trying to make it difficult for me on purpose.

Not only was I surprised at how delicious, soft, and warm they were but they delivered until 3 AM! The location at University of Arizona is one of their better locations.

However, this Insomnia location in Santa Barbara is a hit or miss. I've had some great experiences and some really terrible ones. The quality and service is a hit or miss as well. I recently ordered cookies after craving some around 10:30 PM. The pick up time was 11:00. I arrive and the door is locked with a note saying ""ran out of cookies be back in 30 minutes."" I had been waiting for 30 minutes when I decided to call their customer support hotline and the customer service representative was extremely surprised at the note and how nobody was opening the door. Luckily, she was able to get a hold of the employee and I got my box of cookies. The cookies were not good quality at all, they were hard and crunchy with no flavor. They gave me the vegan option instead of the regular chocolate chip as they had run out. Maybe the vegan version is supposed to be like that? I'm not sure but I know I won't be ordering the vegan option as it was not a pleasant experience.

Being understanding, I gave Insomnia SB another try. The kind lady at the register provided excellent service and the cookies were delicious! A few days later, my boyfriend and I go on a date at Sandbar and decide to watch A Quiet Place II. We went to Insomnia as I was craving them again. The boy at the register helped me and the quality of the cookies were delicious again.

Overall, all I can say is that it is a hit or miss experience depending on whoever is working at the register at the time. I suggest visiting in the afternoon as they have the best employees working at that time.

We ordered the BLT + A (which is the most amazing thing ever! sundried tomato and pork belly, arugula - ah! So delicious!!) and an egg frittata (which was pretty middle of the road decent). I asked for an ice tea, but got an ice coffee. Overall the ambiance is gorgeous, and the food was really good, but service wasn't the best.

Put more servers and baristas on the schedule on the weekends! You are in a touristy spot of downtown in the middle of summer!

Not only did we wait for a while which I could not understand seeing there where so many empty tables, but the so called manager refused to sit us after my husband confronted her after she escorted a couple groups of people that just walked in to tables while we were still waiting.  He was trying not to make it a racial issue but it was so obvious because the people she escorted where all white.  What made it worst was that she saw us waiting yet never took the time to ask if we have been helped.  I have never been treated like this before and I never knew how it felt like being discriminated against, this restaurant surely succeeded In giving me that awful experience.  This place should fire all their employees especially the women who said she was the manager for treating people this way.  They refused to give us their names and a number to file a complain.  Better yet, they should stop serving people and just close their doors if they can't hire people with people skills.  We are Polynesians, and I'm a nurse and my husband a mechanical engineer.  Our money is just as good as those white people.  It's very sad to see stupidity, racist, bigotry and ignorant people working in places that we choose to go with our families.

We were very excited to try this spot on our first day in Santa Barbara- we went in for brunch and the 2 eggs and a toast plate and the chicken and waffles. For appetizer we got the olives and mozzarella dish. 

Let's start with the reason we are giving this place two stars: 
1 - The chicken from the chicken and waffle dish was straight up RAW inside (very soft and pink) and raw goobly disgusting raw fat. We call our waiter to let him know and he took the plate immediately. 
2 - Their response to the raw chicken. They came back saying THIS WAS THE WAY ITS SUPPOSED TO BE. They frustratedly explained us that because of the way the brine their chicken the bright pink and super soft chicken was completely normal. In our book eating bright pink soft chicken IS NOT NORMAL. And raw white gobbly fat is plain disgusting. Overall, eating chicken like this is DANGEROUS. 
3 - Prices are far too high. $10 for a cup of orange juice? No thank you, $5.50 for a cappuccino? I'll pass! 

On the positive notes:
- The two eggs+toast dish was good. It came with a arugula salad and it was good. I personally enjoyed it! 
- The olives were probably our favorite, great and generous portion for good olives... Sign me up! 
- Other than the chicken incident, the service was good. The host was super nice and very attentive... The only reason we are giving then 2 stars instead on 1 is because she was attentive and very nice when seating us and checked up on us a couple of times.

There was no host as I entered so I went straight to the counter. I didn't know there was any other option. The young woman behind the counter was extremely nice, friendly and helpful when taking my order. I took a seat and another staff member was kind enough to bring me creamer for my coffee and a complimentary carafe of water. 

The staff, atmosphere and location get five stars but the food gets one-two stars. The smoked salmon ""platter"" was chopped (fishy tasting) partially cooked salmon, not smoked salmon (lox), and it was served in a cup with creme fraiche, dill and pickle slices. No lemon came with it but I wish it had. The dish comes with rye chips so I asked for baguette slices instead. I thought the baguette would be fresh but it was chewy and doughy. The thinly sliced pickles were great.

I also had a side of cold pole beans. They had the flavor of curry and something else I cannot pinpoint but it was an odd flavor pairing with beans. This odd side dish was $6. 

I got a chocolate croissant to go, heated it later in the day and was disappointed with that as well. They have an in house bakery so you'd think it would be better but it was too thick, not light and flaky as a real croissant should be. 

I loved the lemonade but again, that was expensive. The coffee was the worst. The mug they serve it in is way too large. I kept pouring more and more creamer and adding stevia thinking that would help the flavor but it didn't. Worst coffee I've ever had.

While the drink itself was quite good- I can't say the same for the service my friend and I received. While my friend and I were awaiting our drinks, both she and I busied ourselves by appreciating the calm, serene vibe the coffee shop had to offer. Standing nearest to the portion of the coffee bar table where you would receive your coffee, they have a large espresso machine with an array of small espresso cups that they serve for those who choose to dine in. My friend found them to be absolutely adorable, and showed such appreciation by picking one up to admire it, and show me being that it was my first time seeing their own merchandise. 
What played out after is what deemed my three star review. My friend was then rudely shown that her action was not appropriate. After placing the cup back in its position, barista David immediately wrenched the cup practically out of her hand and chucked it in the sink to be washed. All while simultaneously evading eye contact, as if she weren't there to witness it. 
Now, while my friend soon realized that her action constituted a health hazard, David's reaction was entirely unnecessary, as his coworker even mentioned as such, noting that it was very rude. 
My friend has been coming here for a very long time. So much so that after giving birth to her daughter, the owners were nice enough to send coffee to her hospital bedroom. She has always been a well known customer, and this response was entirely unnecessary and inappropriate. As I said, she and I really enjoyed the coffee itself, but David made our experience very uncomfortable and unwelcome. I have attached a picture of the cups I am referring to.

The sandwich was okay with some kind of upscale deli ham (prosciutto maybe). The salads were better; not great, but solid good. My buddy had a quiche which he liked (good but not great) even though it was his 3rd choice. They were out of the first two choices. He was really jonesing for the bacon. :(  Oh well.

Donuts were also fine except, for the price, they were nothing special.  Not much selection and the flavors were obviously created to be new and improved to the old style donut.  My biggest disappointment was that they only  had coffee.  No latte or espresso or cappuccino.  Just coffee.  I miss the old Peet's with the energy of people sitting and talking and working.

They have two separate areas- one was the donut/latte station & the other was empanada/beer. This made everything kind of confusing because more people started coming in and you couldn't tell who was waiting for what.
My friend ended up just getting a vanilla creme sprinkle donut and I just got two doggy donuts & a iced matcha latte (that I forgot to even get since we were too busy waiting for our empanadas on the other side). I'm super bummed out that I forgot my iced latte! It costed $5 and what bothered me the most was that it looked so good from the picture I saw.

These donuts are pricey, but I was convinced at that point that they were amazing. So I went back.

The next 2 times I visited were less that satisfying. The donut holes when I next had them were severely over spiced to the point that they were like perfume to me.. and when I brought this up to them my next visit I received no consideration or accommodation by the employee after my bad donuts, which is why this is a 2 and not 3 star review- those perfume donut holes kind of ruined my morning. 

The other donuts are hit and miss. sometimes the glaze is a bit off, and the offering are few, and the available flavors are too ""crazy"" to hit the spot that I want a donut to hit. If they kept it a little simpler, and were consistent, they could be an amazing (albeit expensive) donut spot. 

They don't last long once you bring them home, so eat them same day or encounter a melted oily dough mess. (Not a negative comment just some

The Pog, a passionfruit donut, lacked tang. Their famous browned butter with sea salt tasted like a pretty bland glazed donut and had absolutely no taste of sea salt. The Nutella Cream was pretty meh, too. In fact the last few donuts, we just took a bite or two out of each, then threw them away.

-our entrees took close to 45 minutes to come out, and when they did my steak frites was way over cooked (medium well vs medium rare) and my fries were cold. They re made the meal but this took another 20 minutes (vs the 6 minutes they promised)
-the whole process of getting the check took another 45 minutes (from the time we asked for the check to when we got our card back...and that was just because we went to the host stand and asked what was taking so long)

Needed to find some food after going to The Moxi Museum and this place was nearby. Had some decent hope for the food but the service is completely lacking. 

Apparently there is supposed to be a host/hostess at the stand to greet you but no one was at their station. We ended up ordering at the counter and had to specify that we wanted the food for here while the lady who took our order looked confused. 

At least 5 employees on staff but it didn't look like anyone knew what they were supposed to be doing and all congregating behind the counter at the same time at times. 

We ordered rigatoni, a burger without the bun and a wild arugula salad. 

While we were waiting for our food I noticed that another table with kids came in and were offered crayons and a placemat with some games and things to color. That was never offered to us. My sister had to go ask an employee if we could get some for her kids. 

Our table was missing place settings and they never bothered to bring that either. I just grabbed them off a nearby table instead of asking since no one was around to ask. 

There were two managers in suits standing by the food window that would just stare at food being placed on the window but wouldn't even ask passing employees to deliver the food. They didn't even get out of my way when I went to where they were standing to get straws. Just stared at me as I had to walk around them to get to the counter. So not sure what the point of them standing there was except to look authoritative. 

Kitchen was slow and it took nearly 30 mins to get any food once we ordered. We also watched out food sit on the counter under a heat lamp until the steam stopped coming off the food. Even had to ask an employee if we could get our food that we were staring at since no one seemed to care it was sitting there. 

Water was also brought to the other tables in the dining room and again, none was offered or brought to us. 

The main complaint about the food is that the wild arugula salad was on a bed of mixed greens. There was no arugula. However, there were prepackaged versions of the salad in a cold case so I at least know arugula existed in this establishment. 

The food itself was mediocre but with the service, I wish I could give this place negative stars. For the amt of money we spent, they have a far ways to go to justify the value. Actually getting hot food would be a good place to start.",2019-04-22 01:12:55

You get a number once you order and then they'll bring your food to you which is easy!

I got the wild arugula salad to go with tofu. They give you the salad in one container and the tofu in another which is nice so the salad doesn't get soggy, but also felt weird getting a slab of tofu in a box. The salad was HUGE (very arugula heavy and asparagus/strawberry light), but still good. 

I'd say it's a little pricier for such simple food that isn't unique to the restaurant or town, but it's a great quick service option if you just need to grab something easily.",2020-02-26 07:30:29

We started by ordering drinks - Bloody Mary's and coffees. I know I could grow tomatoes faster than the bartender could make a drink. The coffees came AFTER we were done with breakfast. 

Our entrees - we were a party of 9 and ordered 9 entrees and some additional sides. Six entrees were delivered. A few minutes later, 2 more. Twenty minutes later we're having our places bussed and the 9th entree finally arrives - a wet, runny, barely cooked quiche. 

We ask to speak to the manager, but our server says she's very busy in back but will try to get her. She comes back and says the manager is unavailable but asks if she can help. We explain the situation and let her know that this was very poor delivery on the part of the restaurant. She apologized and said she would take some items off our bill. 

She walked in and the manager was standing 20' from our table going over the receipt with her, but never came over to us. While they were discussing the invoice, the food runners were delivering our side dishes to our fully bussed table. Was this a joke?

The server came back and explained she removed the one entree and the late sides. As we're paying our bill, the tea one of our guests ordered at the beginning of breakfast was finally delivered already in a paper cup, because the obviously realized we were on our way out the door. 

Restaurants get busy.

With that said, I am having trouble understanding the setup and the services of this place...  
There is a little podium right at the entry, where I believe a host shall  greet and seat customers..  Only that gal was always busy going around and round...

There are ordering stations at the left side of the restaurant, where delicious food is displayed in glass frig and ladies ready to take your order for drinks and meals...   Only they won't take your order if you want to dine in...

So I guess we should have checked in with the ever-present host at the door when we first entered... But she was no where to be seen!!!

We couldn't get seated even if we wanted to dine in!!!

So we had to order to go, had a # stake in our hands, but there were no place for us to stand and wait!!!  There were about 10 people standing and crowding right outside the kitchen window, where all the servers and waiters scrambling for plates...

So these 10 people waited and waited...   and waited....

In the next 20 min to 30 min we waited... In the meantime, of the 3 or 4 to-go orders, none of our numbers were called.....  No one call any to-go orders!!!

Then one customer finally got impatient and complained... A lady (manager?) went to the kitchen counter/window, checked on few slips, and pulled his orders, which have been sitting on the counter waiting for no less than 5 min...

So I got mad, because our order was placed before that gentleman's... I approached the lady and asked...  Quickly, she checked the slip, checked again, and pulled a brown bag from the kitchen window and handed to us... Our order has been sitting and waiting on that counter for about 10 min....  Our hot food was already getting cold!!!  

Needless to say, the terrible setup and services have left bad taste in our mouths before we ate anything in this place!!!

There are some simple tweets and changes I could suggest... But I don't know if I have any patience left...

This place totally deserves a good 4 or 5 stars.....  But until it figures out what changes it needs to make to enhance/improve the dining/to-go experience, this fine restaurant would only get a 2 or 3 from general public.....

I love to be consistent in what I do. Grading and reviewing is one of those things. 1 stars means you did nothing right. 5 stars means you did everything right aka perfection. 3 stars is average. Handlebar was that. Average IMO. 

I was actually pumped when I walked in. They had some local wholesale stuff, it was well laid out, you could see the grinding machine and roasting stuff inside which I love, and they had a restaurant you can eat at for lunch also. Very cool look and feel. 

I have been to ALOT of coffee shops though. I know what good unique smooth coffee is. I always judge by having a cold brew, because it gives you the true flavor of the bean IMO. This cold brew was good, not great, but good. The latte though, poor. It tasted like flavored milk. Not a good combo of flavor, and not good portion control.

I've now tried several of their flavors.  They have a lot of ""innovative"" flavors --- passion fruit and berry and whatnot --- and they're artfully designed with consummate swirls and just-so garnishes.  They look very fancy.

The problem is they aren't actually that good.  The dough has a strange pillowy texture and the donut is so tall that it can be (although this sounds weird) kind of annoying to chew.  It doesn't have any particularly great flavor either; it just tastes like slightly sugary dough.  All the flavor is in the icing.  And those flavors are pretty good, with a decent amount of punch.  But the icing layer is very thin so what you get is a huge mouthful of plain dough with a little dash of some exotic flavor.

The donuts aren't bad by any means.  They're okay.  The problem is they cost about $4 each and that is unreasonably high given their fair-to-middling taste.

About three blocks away is Spudnuts, which serves good old donuts.  Not farm-to-table or anything fancy, just, you know, extremely unhealthy fried dough, with a sizable layer of traditional icing like chocolate, vanilla, or maple, and some traditional toppings like peanuts, coconut, sprinkles, and so on.  Those donuts cost around $1.60 or so and are, at least for my tastes, actually better than Hook and Press.  Hook and Press would need to be at least twice as good as Spudnuts to justify their prices, and they are not really even equal.

I'm open to the idea of gourmet donuts.  I've been to the much-ballyhooed Voodoo Donuts.  Once in a while I might be willing to pay $4 for a donut if it's really gourmet.  These donuts, I'm afraid, are actually just a ripoff.  Your donut budget would be better used elsewhere.",2021-07-17 07:15:25

Handlebar has lots of unique flavorful roasts which I've really enjoyed as I visit SB 1-2 times per year.

Then I ordered an Ethiopia. Which is my favorite roast of theirs. NOPE. That's not what they are brewing today. Guys, what's the fucking point of having 3-5 unique roasts if you don't even serve them?!  They only have a giant pot of one kind brewed - so you also don't get the flavor profile of single pours.

It was an impulse decision that we got 2 donuts. We came for empanadas in the same store, was lured into the donuts. Ended up convincing ourselves that we needed to try two of their flavors: S'mores and Chocolate creme brulee. 

Their donuts are very well decorated, very IG-friendly. However, if you are only getting a few donuts on the go, they package it in a little paper bag easy for you to carry or put in a purse/bag. It broke my heart when they put the well decorated S'more donut in those tight little white bag, ruining the marshmallow cream on the top!! 

The chocolate creme brulee donut really was meh. Not enough chocolaet filling inside and the chocolate creme wasn't as soft and fluffy as I wish it had been. The glaze on the top mimicking the creme brulee sugar work didn't justify its uniqueness. I was honestly quite disappointed. 

Turning to the s'mores donut, I definitely liked the marshmallow cream on the top and how it was slightly charred. What I found underwhelming on this donut, however, was the donut itself. The bread was way too dense for my liking, and almost made the donut taste stale.

So i screeched to a halt and checked it out. It was evening which is unusual for me as basically i am a day coffee guzzler but so be it.
The building has been beautifully re-designed having been a former Safeway store built in the '30's which means this place is huge compared to the downtown store. Unfortunately some of things i did not admire about that store have slithered on over to this Midtown store.
For one: the service is a bit sloppy as if the training received is incomplete or incomprehensible. The clerks knowledge about all things Handlebar is often hazy as in for example what brews are available and which ones are not. And if you advertise several Roasts: why/how can you not offer them all, all the time? 
Also:  the music is so loud that i could not hear when my coffee concoction was ready for pickup. I ordered my Capp with Oat Milk (!) which i had never heard of. Good item, actually.
Fortunately, i arrived on a evening on which they offered Roman-style pizzas. btw: HB now offers lots of new in house made breakfast and lunch items.
Ok, so a Roman style pizza is a pretty unusual and special thing and only available here (though not all the time i surmise).
The Roman Pizza dough is fermented for several days (not just overnight) which gives the final baked a crunchiness and a depth of flavor not usually evident in other styles of pizza. In Italian, it is called, ""scrocchiarella.""
The Roman Pizza here was thin crust, crackley and the topping was spare: both sauce and cheese were not the main thing but merely an addition to the beauty of the thin, charred crust.
I hear they have also had a Ramen night and the morning pastries are also done in house.
Pricing is on par with most other specialty coffee houses: as in too expensive! But you get what you pay for here. And it seems that the Handlebar is moving in the right direction what with the interesting new food, dinner special evenings and good coffee. Galettes? Chive Scones? Yes!

I was very excited, and I have been following them on Instagram for awhile. Yesterday, Friday 10/26/18, was my first visit to Hook and Press. They had 7 flavors available so I bought one of each- pb & j, vanilla bean, apple crumble, fig & honey, pumpkin cheesecake, POG, and Mexican cocoa. They had sold out of browned butter so I didn't get to try that one. These are pricey suckers at $3.25/each. I paid $22.75 for my order of 7 donuts.

While these are tasty donuts and fun to try, I was disappointed that each donut has exactly the same base- ie. a vanilla donut in a ring shape. The only difference is what is placed on top of it. There are no fillings or nothing unique inside the vanilla donut. Note that the donut itself was somewhat firm. I expected it to be a bit fluffier. I like firm donuts though- my favorite local ones are the vanilla cake w/rainbow sprinkles from Spudnuts or Eller's. 

My suggestion to the owners is to make each donut more unique. For example, make a filled donut. I had hoped the Mexican cocoa would be filled (like the Krispy Kreme cream filled donuts), but there was only a bit of cream inside the center ring. Make a donut that has apple cinnamon flavors INSIDE of it, instead of just on the top. Put peanut butter or jelly INSIDE the donut. Do you know what I mean? Make more shapes, fun varieties, and add more variety besides just some cool icing on a vanilla donut. 

I found the price point too expensive for a new donut shop in Santa Barbara. They are pricing themselves similarly to well-established donuts shops in larger towns, such as Blue Star. Nobody in my workplace will be able to swing by and pick up a dozen for the office, as that alone is $39.

Deux bakery does so much that is right on an everyday basis that it was a big surprise that the croissants we ordered for a family 4th of July brunch were only average: in taste, in conformation and in the natural things a good croissant exhibits: flakiness, crispiness and buttery-ness.
Yes, of course some of these qualities were happening: just not enough of any on these attributes.
Deux took a ""special order"" for these which lead me on thinking about this that the croissants were bake-off from frozen. Why did i think this? Making Croissant dough is a time consuming process: working the dough, and then re-working it and then re-working it. It is not something you can take an order for ""off the cuff"" per se. 
I may be wrong of course but as in Don Quixote...""the proof is in the pudding."" So whether they were prepared from fresh dough or from frozen bake off: they were in fact, underwhelming. An evaluation that i would usually give to a place like 85 degrees or other bake off from frozen bakery.
Deux is amongst the few bakeries in California that produces over the top quality baked goods. These croissant are below the quality that i expect from them.
The Croissants themselves were not as crispy and flaky or buttery as any in my ""Croissant Derby"" (NE/Los Angeles bakeries only) and frankly i was/am disappointed.
If these are bake off: Deux i feel was merely trying to make us happy by selling us something we craved. If the Croissant we picked up were done in house, their recipe needs tightening and re-evaluation.
In either case, Deux will remain the place to go for baked good in Santa Barbara. I mean this place does excellent pies, cakes, breads of all types, etc. And does them beautifully. 
Miss Wendy and crew produces miracles in their small bakery. Santa Barbara is proud to have Deux and I will return again and again.",2021-07-05 19:49:57

The Cowboy Cookie here is great - get this and an Americano and you're sure to enjoy a relaxing afternoon here (if you're able to snag a seat or table!). They have a decent selection of beers and kombucha, and if you get there in a decent time, several fresh pastries and light meal items.

It's always a bit stressful to snag a table here. There are several two-person tables, often occupied by just one person working (...I'm also guilty of causing this, too). The line doesn't move too fast, so I normally use that time to use eagle eyes to catch a newly opened table. This probably means leaving the line to snag the table, but that's normally the cost of getting a good spot!

Note that the register beside the merchant (facing the main entrance) is for non-espresso. It moves WAY faster, so decide what drink or treat you want based on the line.

The WiFi isn't fast, so it often makes it difficult to start work projects with work that require downloading or uploading files. Bring a fully charged computer because there are no plugs! And I would highly discourage working from here if you have a video or phone work call - the concrete floors, warehouse size, and  possible coffee roasting can make it *very* loud inside. That noise plus slow WiFi can make it really frustrating to try to work here.

The parking is limited in their parking lot, and street parking can be tricky given the traffic on De La Vina. Say a prayer to get a spot and hopefully avoid walking 2 blocks or searching for a close spot for 10 min.",2018-07-23 19:23:56

It turns out that they are $3-4 each because they use local ingredients. They also don't use any weird ingredients in their donuts and apparently help you not feel gross after you consume them. I stand by my review that I wasn't amazed and I don't recommend you stand in line for these unless you are doing it for the gram. Not trying to be rude, I just wasn't impressed. 

For even more context, I live in the bay area so maybe I just have high standards? It's not that I have bougie taste because I love a Cambodian donut place out in the bay. However, I've also had out the door line donuts like Voodoo or Blue Star in Portland and I criticized those, too. I will say the gal who helped us here was nice but our interaction was brief since there was no line. 

Original post: 

We love donuts so when we visit a city, we try to find a great donut place. This was super underwhelming and I do not think these $3-4 donuts are worth it. 

This location isn't easy to spot and shares the space with a beer tap room and an Argentinean empanada place. Luckily, the Argentinean empanadas were worth the price. 

They only had about 7 donut flavors and I wasn't into any of them. I ended up choosing their buttermilk sprinkles one and it honestly tasted like a regular donut from any donut place. My husband chose their cinnamon and the topping was try. 

The dough is light and fluffy but the flavor on top is basic. I didn't see any other donut shops on State Street so maybe people hype this place up because it looks cute and the donuts look Instagram worthy, but taste wise, even Krispy Kreme is better.

I have no problem paying $4 for a donut but it has to be amazing. This was not worth the price so I recommend skipping this place.",2021-06-11 02:31:57

Quite some time had passed and she finally asked how can she help me. I told her this is my first time there.
""Where are the other flavors?""

She gave me the rundown on how after they sellout. They work with what they have and to come earlier for more choices. Cool!

I ordered banana foster. I'm a fan of banana bread and thought. This can't be too bad of a choice.

Walking down state street. Too eager to wait and bring the doughnut to my office. I slid my mask off to taste. 
And ate the whole thing. I questioned going back to get another one. But also considered encountering a time delay with the girl. So I didn't.

The flavor was great. And the texture and the quality of the dough was reminiscent of doughnuts my mom used to make when I was a child at home. The doughnut was so good. I called my brother to tell him about it. He lives in  another state.  Not only did my tastebuds get to experience something great on the Friday afternoon.

We were enticed by the daily special and asked one of the staff members what it was. She had no idea so I asked the next employee and he had no idea. The 3rd employee said it was a pumpkin bar so we said yes to it. Our server brought us our coffee and pumpkin bar to the table. As we were conversing and eating we realized this bar we had ordered definitely had no pumpkin and very much tasted like peanut butter. We were fine with it as neither has a peanut allergy but we felt like we should let the staff know so they could be aware as this could of been critical for someone with an allergy. We informed our server and he said ok I'll let the counter person know. He did not say he would inform a manager or send one our direction. We paid our bill and left but I still felt compelled to inform a manager. I tried calling the next morning and left a message for a manager to return my call.

Secondly, the food was a bit overpriced, it was delicious don't get me wrong! Super filling! But 16 bucks for a sandwich I can make at home ? the avocado turkey sandwich was a bit messy because how much avocado was in it but it was worth the mess!

During our long weekend in Santa Barbara, my wife and I sat here for coffee each morning as it was right next to our vacation rental.  It's a beautiful looking shop, and is attached to a larger restaurant that looks great for brunch. This review is only for the coffee shop. 

I'm sure that we went on an off weekend for them, but they didn't have espresso beans for half of our trip. They have a sign outside that tells you about all of the differences in each cup of coffee they make, and 90% of them require espresso shots. I'm not sure if they were busier than normal, but that is a must if you are a coffee place. They also didn't have a lot of the display case, in terms of breakfast. We did get a croissant, which was great.

After reading all the rave reviews about Hook and Press, i was so excited to try it! The flavors were so unique and sounded appealing. However, after trying them, they were nothing special

ORDERING
We pre-ordered online since many reviews said that they run out of flavors quickly. It was easy and quick to pick up the next morning. When you walk in, there are boxes lined up on the table and you just look for your name. Didn't have to deal much with any of the workers so can't really comment on service.

DONUTS
The dough itself was so tough, more like bread. The inside was airy so i didn't understand why it was such a tough, chewy donut. I felt like it was overly sweet (yes, contrary to what others have said). I was super excited for their flavor offerings but i feel like it just fell short of expectations.

PRICES
I normally wouldn't mind paying $4 for unique flavor donuts such as these but for what i got, i just felt it was too pricey. I'm glad i tried it but i probably won't be back.",2021-09-08 23:22:27

After a quick run in the morning, my mom and I picked up our donuts and coffee which I preordered the night before. My order was set to be picked up at 8:30 but I got the ""ready to be picked up"" alert around 7:45. It's good that they are efficient and quick which I really appreciated.
When I got there, the line was probably 3-4 ppl long but the poor, lone barista was doing everything herself which made the wait a bit longer. Though she was incredibly nice and sweet, I felt bad because I preordered 6 drinks and she had to make them all on her own in the middle of taking other peoples orders. 
Now for the products:
- Coffee was amazing, which seems the be the trend here in SB! I bet those visiting the area, do not go to Starbucks or any generic coffee shop you can get anywhere else. There are sooo many delicious, small bizz coffee joints that are much more worth your money. My mom very much enjoyed her vanilla latte and said it was her favorite among the 3 places we visited for coffee!
- Among the 5 donuts I ordered, the donut holes were my fave! It's like a better version of regular donut holes. 
- The brown butter donut was a bit too salty in my opinion and the lemon olive oil wasn't very flavorful. I didn't get a chance to try the other two but I think it's safe to say that these are pretty basic donuts with just a small bit of an upgrade.
But my dog loved the lil dog treats they have to offer!!

Then when a waitress walked by, 10 minutes later, I asked for some and one was provided. We did not see a server again for over 10 minutes. Water was brought and as our table was wobbly, the water spilled out of the glasses when my husband's knee hit the table accidentally. No one was around to help with the clean up so we used all four of our cloth napkins to clean up the spill and we piled the discarded napkins in the middle of the table. We then ordered food and drinks and asked for more napkins. Three were brought. Our food took forever to come out and when it was finally served I asked the person who brought the food (which happened to be the hostess) if she could take the wet cloth napkins so we would have more room on our rather small table and she looked at me in a very annoyed way and reluctantly took them. When we saw our server again some time later (his name was Ian) I asked for more napkins and another coke for my son. At no time were we asked if the food was ok or if any more drinks were needed. In the meantime, the table next to us left and their table remained uncleared for the remainder of our meal. After we had finished eating I asked for the bill and Ian brought it and finally my son's coke, 30 minutes after I had ordered it. I told him we didn't need it anymore and he said ""It's on the house"" and I said no thank you and reminded him we were never brought the additional napkins we had asked for. The whole experience was so disappointing. The restaurant looked lovely upon our arrival which is why we decided to eat there but the food was mediocre and the service was terrible. I should also mention the restaurant was almost empty, maybe 8 tables total were taken. It was not like they were super busy which would have explained the poor service, it was only at about a quarter capacity.

We finally came by in the morning on a weekday and ordered two PB cup lattes, one vegan, one original.  
I am not exaggerating when I say that it was the worst coffee I have ever tasted.  A friends of ours was the one who recommended this drink so we tried to come by and try it but it was literally the worst thing I've tasted in years.  It tasted nothing like peanut butter cups, or even like a latte TBH  Super watery and gross. 

We are coffee buffs, so maybe if you're someone who doesn't care about quality coffee so much, you can handle it.  But it was not cheap, and was basically just a watery latte.  Later, when we were washing out the cups to recycle them, we noticed that there was all this PB caked onto the bottom.  Did the employee just not bother to stir it?  Even if they had though, it was just awful coffee, plain and simple. 

Another issue was the customer service.  When we went in, there were two employees:  the one who made our drinks, and a guy who appeared to be the manager.  We were standing in front of the register (as their only waiting customers) for forever before he even made eye contact with us.  He just continued to do other tasks (I've worked in a fast casual before; dude, when a customer walks up, they're the money LOL put down whatever you're doing because it can wait).  It took so long for him to acknowledge us that we almost just left (should have).  When we finally were greeted, he was just like, ""oh hey be with you in a minute"" without looking at us and making eye contact.  Pretty bad. 

0/10 would not come back.  Only reason this is not a 1-star is that we didn't try their donuts and can't speak on those menu items.

If it's a weekend, they're open til 2:30 and it's only 10am and the word ""donuts"" is in your name .... it's a little silly to be out of them ‍ it was ok though because we managed to get one of the last 3 donuts. I didn't want to be greedy so we just got the 1 bananas foster donut and let other people behind us have a chance to get one. It was very good, too bad we couldn't try any other ones. We're from out of town... otherwise we would come back to try different ones. The peanut butter latte my boyfriend got didn't really taste like peanut butter to me... there was a strange charcoal flavor. He said there was barely any coffee flavor. However, my vanilla latte was pretty good. The person (female) who rang us up was really nice. She felt bad that they were out of donuts but it wasn't her fault. One thing I didn't care for was that there was a guy who I assume is the owner behind the bar making the drinks... we were next up in line but he decides to look past us to the two girls behind us In line and take their drink orders first. We also ordered two lattes that he should have made first. They got their drinks before us which I felt was rude. Before we got to the front of the line we noticed he was doing it to other people too which doesn't make sense because it should be first come first serve. Anyway- that drink thing and the fact that they rant out of donuts was annoying and the reason for the 3 stars. I still gave her a tip because she was really nice and there's a pandemic going on and all. But this is an honest review.

Update 2/17/21: it's interesting that the owner posted a response to my review yesterday 2/16 and then edited it today 2/17. He probably realized that the first response where he said I ""should know"" that him skipping us and taking the girls'  orders behind us was ""not intentional"" was condescending. That response is now gone. He is now stating that he took people's orders who did not already have drinks in hand .... well we didn't have drinks in hand either and you skipped right over us. I was going to ignore his first response even though it came off as condescending because going back and forth on Yelp is not what I'm all about. I was simply giving my opinion and sharing what my experience was. He should take it for what it is and not give a rude response and then edit it. I'm not looking for anything for Free or a redo. In addition- it's petty to go back and forth about whose order was taken first or second, etc. I mentioned this so that they don't do it to other people in the future. There's tons of other dessert, coffee and donut places in Santa Barbara I could go to. I also think it was unnecessary for him to look at my reviews of other places and tell me I should give them a second chance. I will be giving them a second chance, just not Hook and Press.

Typically the coffee is great, atmosphere is pleasant, and the staff is quite friendly. However, recently the customer service and COVID-19 protocols have been sincerely alarming and make supporting this local business personally challenging. 

This past week I went into Handlebar about an hour before closing. At the time there were a few people waiting outside for their drinks but I was the only customer in the store. The person taking at the register didn't greet me and when I tried to be friendly and say ""good morning"" they still didn't say a word which was off putting and extremely awkward. Still without saying anything, they continued to stare at me while I didn't know if they were ready to take my order or if something was going on behind the scenes that I was unaware about that would prevent them from taking my order. After an uncomfortable 10 seconds of silence I ordered and payed and walked away, still without a word from anyone behind the counter. 

While I felt slightly uneasy, what made me truly upset was the lack of COVID precautions.

Personally, I didn't feel comfortable touching a stack of about 50 lids, and also didn't like the idea that customers throughout the day had been touching the same lids I was about to drink out of. What made it even more upsetting was the fact that the employee made me feel like I was dumb for not just grabbing a lid, when  that seems absurd during these times. 

Overall, I felt like the experience wasn't worth the $8 for the coffee. More importantly, there seems to be a culture of judgement/mistreatment unless you are a regular or somehow fit their idea of the ""Handlebar"" customer. I hope to see some changes because I truly enjoy the quality of their coffee and want to continue to support local business.",2021-01-13 20:43:02

If you like your coffee sweeter like me, then you should ask for it sweeter because I barely tasted the vanilla flavor. If you enjoy your latte not sweet, then this is the place for you. This was my first time here so I didn't know. 

I came here on a Saturday morning and stopped here on the way to Solvang for a little day trip because the reviews were hyping it up. It gets busy; there was a line out the door and curved along the parking lot. Also, they have nice outdoor patio seating",2021-05-15 04:57:13

Our server (forgot her name but she's blonde) We ordered our drinks. We ordered our food. Our food arrived BEFORE our drinks. It took more than 10-15 minutes to get our drinks. It wasn't busy from where I was sitting so I don't understand why it would take so long. Also, my food had a hair on it. They took it back and brought it out my new but forgot the two modifications I asked for in the beginning so I couldn't enjoy it. At that point, I was beyond over the restaurant. It's overpriced, the service was terrible and the food is whatever. I'm not from the area but whoever does visit SB, I will definitely not mention this place.",2021-08-30 02:30:49

Person at the register was rude. Straight up. Donuts went beyond ""disappointing"" and into ""abysmal"" from the first bite.

I think the problem is that most of this place's ""shine"" comes from the fact that is has ""clever"" flavors. Unfortunately they still have to taste good. Ours did not.

Maybe it was an off day? Ours tasted day old, and slightly soggy. The flavors were... not there. I mean a complete miss. 

I think people get excited that they're ordering something called ""Strawberry Basil"" and then they take a photo of it and then give the business 5 stars.

I'm not kidding when I say that I think we'd have been happier with a Winchell's glazed.",2021-07-15 18:09:02

I was highly confused if I was supposed to wait to be seated, seat myself or order at the counter. After approaching the counter, they said I could take a seat if I wanted (still confused- is that what I'm supposed to do?!) Anyway, I took a seat and they DO have table service for dinner. 

It is a cute café style restaurant with a deli counter (some bakes goods and salads) and a mini-accoutrement shop off to the side with wine, jellies, some small gifts, etc. It is a pretty casual but modern atmosphere with not so casual prices. I gathered the theme was healthy food with a Moroccan twist. They don't have a large menu for dinner items, but I actually like that as I frequently have difficulty making decisions. I opted for the Kale Caesar and added Grilled Salmon. It was honestly just okayyyyyy- could've used some sea salt or more flavor in the dressing. Staff was friendly and I enjoyed my experience (after the awkward seating sitch) so I'd give this place another go.",2019-01-30 06:43:09

I watched the same guy walk a 30 foot stretch over and over picking up and setting down the same rag. There was no water refill at any point, lots of upset tables with issues with their checks. The young hostess was very friendly. Most of the employees wandering around seemed lost like they weren't sure what their job was. The rest of the staff was beyond slow and not super personable. It took  around 30 minutes to get our check. 

The food presentation was good but way overpriced. The ""smash burger"" is not a smash burger, thick patty more like a steak burger? It was good flavor but just not what the menu said by any stretch. Also didn't have the normal smash burger flavor of being cooked in mustard. 

The fries were a large portion as pictured good thing for an extra $4, heavily seasoned in Lawrys.",2021-10-24 20:45:48
