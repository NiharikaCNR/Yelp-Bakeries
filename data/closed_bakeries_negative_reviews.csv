bi6GaeWDGceGv62lXTIKQA,RgtbLaiU22zqaCk20HgbiQ,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,1,1,0,0,"Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5.
I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other ""small"" items.",2015-01-04 02:26:46

Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential, but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience, they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer.",2014-10-12 19:23:18

I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.  I was watching them as the food came out of the kitchen and neither the kitchen staff nor the people serving had any idea what was going on.  Everyone looked clueless.

""So can I see your breakfast menu?"" ....""um, we don't have food here...just pastries, and oh, yes on Sunday we serve burritos"" -I SEE! The pastries stood there looking like more like fossils in a museum, far a part from each other, dry looking and utterly unappetizing. Void of course of prices, as if not expected to be purchased and eaten, no we are here as a metaphor, like the name of this place. The persons behind the counter are an odd bunch, the young girl is so oddly serious and aloof, for this kind of concept, while the bearded man seems like he just rolled out of his bed, and not a very comfortable one, if you know what I mean...the only one that fits the ""concept"" of ""eat cool, chill vibe, instead of messy food"" is the young dude, with the glasses, who might be the rich kid who's parents finance this.  Maybe they were secretly fans of the Breakfast Club (the ancient film) and settled on just the half part, not to give away their age.... I don't know, but this name is so very predictable to the essence of this place: cool on the outside, empty inside.

On a side not: photographs are terrific, and so is the idea of supporting those artists, but why not stay true to what you want to be? Either drop the name or bring on the breakfast, and it better be a damn good one!",2016-08-06 05:35:24

When I went there today, I had to drive back and forth 3 times before I could find a parking space. When you get inside, there's a tiny sign on the cash register that tells you where there is a parking lot, but you still have to ask where it is. I wasn't even sure I could find anywhere for myself or the 2 people with me could sit - we managed to grab the last spot while we looked at menus - if we waited, it would have been gone and we would have been eating at the counter, I guess, since the staff wasn't even paying attention to how much seating there was and just kept taking orders.  I went to stand in line to order. While I was in line (next up to order) some people walked up and stood on the other side of the person ordering while I was standing there waiting - and the staff began taking their order, ignoring me.

The restaurant was not busy, yet the tables were not bussed and were dirty.  We ordered and sat outside, and even the manager walked by without thinking to clean our dirty table, until we asked him over to do so (and to clean the one next to us so we didn't have to look at it too).

We ordered Spinach Eggs Benedict, yet were told that they were out of spinach.  They offered to substitute zucchini, which we accepted - yet had to look hard for when it came.  The hollandaise was more like a mayonnaise without any true flavor.  And while it was good that they didn't overcook the egg so the yolk would still be runny - they way undercooked it, with parts of the white still uncooked.  Yuck.

We were thinking to point that out to them, but there was a definite sense that no one who worked there would have even cared enough.

We also ordered huevos rancheros which was quite under-seasoned and bland. 

We bought a loaf of gluten-free bread to take home, and were seriously unimpressed - threw it away after eating less than half.

The inside atmosphere was fun, with the bright metal and orange colors, yet outdoor seating begs for more plants to hide and soften the boring and busy street corner the restaurant is on.

However, when I think of benedict I think smothered in hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. This place did neither.

Wasn't helpful at all then asked me to step aside so she could assist the person behind me. The person behind seemed to be her friend because her attitude went from like a wall to this cheery talkative thing. Then I had to stand there for about 5 minutes waiting for them to finish. Once I ordered she went back to being rude and lacking hospitality. Ive been in here multiple times. They make you feel like you aren't hip enough to come to their establishment. Which sucks because I've NEVER felt so shut out in a establishment. I've only wrote about 3 yelp reviews in my life but this one had to be done. I chose to remain anon because we have mutual friends.

(gluten? Lol)

Gluten is the glue that holds everything together, and without it, everything falls apart.  I mean this on a spiritual level.

2.)  And the rose matcha fell flat somewhere.  It was neither pronounced in rose or matcha flavor.  You need to pick a side.  You need to make a choice.  You need to commit.  You need to be STRONG with one flavor and have a HINT of the other, but you kinda did neither.   You were half-assed polyamorous.  You didn't pick a winner and run with it.

Even following them from their move to this location our family has been buying bread and pastry from Our Daily Bread for many years. 

Not any more!  

Over the past few weeks, the quality of their products has declined dramatically.  The cases are clearly filled with at least day-old products - choose carefully and look for volume so you can be assured that the breads/pastries were baked recently.  We have found that there are only a few types of bread/pastries in any quantity on the shelves - and if there are only a few left, they are clearly older than a day or two.   Their bread stales quickly so beware.  Shouldn't bakeries clearly label and at least discount day+ old products?

Last week we purchased a few croissant, pastries, breads for a party. The croissants were deformed, oily (where's the butter?), dense, tough and heavy - the baker clearly has no concept of what a real one even looks like, let alone tastes.   Ditto the pastries - Costco does it better!  After a bite or two, we tossed all of them.

But my latte didn't taste like it was professionally pulled and the milk was not steamed in that creamy way that other craft shops do it (Handlebar, etc). It was like getting a decent latte at Nordstrom. 

The toasts that sounded so great on the menu were a real loser. Instead of serving you something amazing, well slathered with butter and jam or cinnamon and sugar, they present you with a barely toasted slice of bread topped with plastic to-go containers of butter, jam, etc. it is a laughable presentation and certainly not Instagram ready if you're into that. Trying to make your own toast with barely toasted bread and way too small, plastic containers of butter and jam is a big drag and the taste is even worse.

Toast is a huge deal in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Apparently it hasn't quite caught on here yet. At least they don't know how to do it.

I'll take their word that they made it from scratch, but it was a bit disappointing.  My husband had the french toast, which basically met his expectations.

I got the French toast with berries which was nothing special at all. Even sadder was that it wasn't really tasty. I have never been to a place where the French toast isn't good...

Unfortunately, the last three times I've gone there, the service has been TERRIBLE. For such a classy restaurant with high-end prices, I expect to at least get decent customer service, but sadly this hasn't been the case. Just two days ago, I went in for a late lunch and the woman I ordered from was completely unfriendly, had an annoyed smirk on her face, and when I thanked her she just ignored me and walked away. She told me she'd bring me the coffee I ordered and for the THIRD TIME I had to ask another waiter to get my cup of coffee after all the food had been brought out. A good breakfast restaurant should know that coffee should be brought to the customer before they're food is brought out 15 or so minutes later after ordering. I was never checked on once after my food and then coffee was delivered to me, and this had been the case my other recent visits to the restaurant. You just walk in, order your food, they deliver it to you, and then your ignored for the remained of your breakfast/lunch. They also used to have the waiters bring you water in glass jars, but now you have to get your own water out of tiny plastic cups... again very tacky and a hassle for such a restaurant. I have received much better service from far less expensive restaurants.

There have been times when their baked goods and desserts were scrumptious while other times, they were just bad and dry with no taste at all. My most recent visit, I had ordered a chocolate cookie that tasted like uncooked dough and I couldn't really taste any chocolate in it. I also ordered smoked salmon plate with bagels and it was very ordinary. The smoked salmon wasn't fresh and bagels were very dry and stale. Even the chicken pesto sandwich was just decent and nothing special. 

Lately, service has been subpar. There were times when I would get a very nice staff worker when I ordered my food. But recently, I would get some that weren't very courteous and unfriendly or even crack a smile.

I'm moving from the Santa Barbara area, so I'm trying to hit all of the ""hot spots,"" as defined by friends and yelp, so Jeannine's was definitely on my list for a brunch stop.

We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday.  Me and the bf just had to wait about ten minutes for a table.  The waiting/ordering/number process is a bit confusing.  We decided on the wild salmon hash and omelet with goat cheese, asparagus tips, and corn.  I ordered a coffee and the bf ordered a latte.  I received a half-full small mug of coffee.  It was very strange.  There were free refills of course, but why didn't I get a full mug to begin with?  The coffee and latte were quality.

We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food, it seemed a bit long.  The food overall was just okay.  It was way under seasoned and under salted.  Even after adding several shakes from the salt shaker, the food was lacking.  The salmon hash was more ""wet"" than expected.  Not in a completely bad way, but I'm used to crunchy, crispy, salty corned beef hash, which was an opposite texture of the salmon hash.  The omelet was just okay.  I recommend Esau's cafe for the best omelet I've had so far in Santa Barbara (or almost best ever at any restaurant).

But, because service and courtesy lacks..... it's really 1 1/2 stars.

We arrived at 7:30am on a Thursday so, there were plenty of tables available.
The cashier seemed to notice we were looking for menus.
Never said a word. I found them tucked away next to the side of the register. So, we were talking over our ordered and she kindly informed us that we could sit down and decide then come back up to order.
 I'm an adult, young lady. I know exactly when I'd like to sit and when it's unnecessary.
So, an elderly couple walked up next to us and heard what she was saying to us.
Then inquired if they now take orders at the tables.
 I wanted to say no, they don't. She just wants to push people around when theres no reason too. There's not that many people here, no reason to rush folks. But, I didn't say a word. I just ignored her.
Then, I'm ordering...of course, i have to order things in her order. I can't just say pancake breakfast with scramble eggs and sausage. Nooooo.... she has to back me up. Start over....first which pancake breakfast... i said there's only one listed. I said buttermilk right as shes schooling me.... do you want multigrain or buttermilk. What kind of eggs...im saying scrambled shes still talking.... I'm saying sausage she listing what meats that are available. (Now who's rushing who?) Irritating!!
She makes me repeat everything as if she didn't hear any thing i said.
Then same thing goes for my biscuits and gravy order.
I order the $12 biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy.... do you want to add eggs for an additional cost?  I just said eggs over easy...ah, wait what? What extra charge? She says eggs are additional $2.
 It clearly states eggs on the friggin menu. I grab the menu and show her $12 biscuits and gravy with eggs. No mention of just biscuits and gravy on menu for $10.
 She just stays in her world and continues to ask if i'm ordering just biscuits and gravy because they offer that too. 
I informed her that I clearly stated I wanted eggs over easy. 
She is clearly too comfortable in her position. 
Anyways, enough of that.
The coffee was terribly strong and just plain terrible. I was shocked because they offer Peets as well but I don't believe it was Peets. It didn't taste like it.
The hubby liked his meal. Perfectly scrambled eggs, good sausage, and large pancakes topped with strawberries and blueberries. He enjoyed all of it.
I ordered a side of potatoes which is a mixture of several types of potatoes. It would've been better if the large thin sliced russets were cooked through. 
The biscuits and gravy were good. Lots of sausage but needed more gravy. Eggs cooked perfectly.  All in all it was good.
Would I come back....hell no. She was the only negative we came across this entire trip and no way I'd put up with that crap again. Too many good places in SB to choose from.",2015-04-03 22:58:32

The restaurant has cute outside seating, and diner-like decor inside. It's all self-seating, and some tables are a little cramped, so be prepared to wait on weekends.

- Coffee, etc: hot drinks, lattes, et al are great and large here! Cute designs in the foam too.
- Breakfast Quesadilla: definitely lacking some pizzazz! I'd say PASS
- California omelette: Good, but not great. Again, missing some pizzazz.
- Breakfast club: Good standard breakfast with the works.
- Low carb: the heavy cream makes this not as much a healthy choice, but it was still very tasty.
- Kahlua French toast: very sweet syrup and served with minimal bananas. They also have no peanut butter here, so bring your own if you want some extra spread!

This place is more a pastry and coffee shop; the cookies, muffins and cakes look delicious!! The Kahlua french toast will satisfy your sweet tooth and the omelettes will fill your belly. The service is just so-so, we had to ask multiple times for napkins, utensils, sides, etc. The coffee is great, probably because they use Peet's, and the juice tastes fresh squeezed. From what we tried, the food is good, just not great. All of the omelettes come with the bare minimum, and it seems like they skimp on the veggies and add-ons. Still, if you like French Toast, I'd say give it a try. If you're more of a traditional breakfast goer, then perhaps another place with a more attentive staff and fully loaded plates.

The potatoes served with the benedict could have also used some more time on the grill. Although they were nicely seasoned, they were positively anemic looking. Hubby's comment upon trying the french toast was ""Your bananas foster french toast is better than this."" Awww, thanks honey, but you want the food you go out and pay for to taste better than the stuff you make at home. I can tell this place is a local favorite, but I think I will keep looking for a slightly better breakfast spot.",2016-05-03 04:56:19

It was a bit overpriced (again, based on going to some very delicious brunch places in LA).  Glad we tried it but don't think we have any real desire to come back - would rather try other brunch places in SB.  

The one really annoying thing was that they have the tiniest water glasses I've ever seen next to the water dispenser - they had some sign about the drought, but come on - there are better ways to deal with that (it mostly comes from agricultural watering, not people drinking water at a restaurant).  We had to get up five times during our short meal to refill water.  Some people had normal water glasses around us and we asked for that, but were just brought the tiny glasses.

So this time we decided to check it out.  Quite honestly it was a disappointment.  So we ordered the breakfast burrito and currant scone.  Here is the breakdown: 

Pros: 
- super cute place.  You order your food and sit down while it's being prepared and then brought to your table.  - The staff is very friendly.  
- They serve breakfast until 3pm!! 

Cons: 
- the decaf coffee was cold and we had to request a new cup 2 times until they finally got it right.  
- I've had my fare share of scones and although it wasn't very sweet (which is a plus), it was too moist (which is good for a cake not a scone) and it was very bland.  It didn't have that dense texture where you would want to add some jam and butter to it.  
- the breakfast burrito was extremely bland and runny. As soon as I bit into it, a ton of juice came out of the burrito.   I couldn't quite tell where it came from as the eggs were cooked well.  Either way, it was soggy. The potatoes had a nice mixture of sweet potato, regular and fancy potatoes but the portion could have been a bit more so it's proportional to the burrito.   The burrito is definitely a good size to share if you don't want a heavy breakfast.

Great food, nothing on the menu is bad. I especially love their ""Apple Jack"" French Toast on the weekends.

If I like it so much, why not five stars? I hate the Santa Barbara restaurant mindset where PEOPLE DONT WAIT ON YOU! You have to stand in a line (especially long on weekends) and order your food from a register (think McDonalds but fancier). Then you feel pressured to PRE-service tip when you complete your order because of the operating system, even though the only service you get is from food runners, and the cashier (but if this is your first time, you won't know that). 

They are a dog friendly establishment, but you must eat outdoors, and the waitstaff gives you the occasional evil eye which subtracts from the dining experience.

I came in during the late morning and was surprised to see how crowded it was.  There were a few people in line in front of me but it moved fast, plus it gave me some time to check out the daily specials.

I was greeted by a stoic cashier. She wasn't unfriendly but she definitely wasn't friendly either.  She seemed like she was ready to be anywhere but there and it showed in her energy.

I ordered 2 coffees, an omlette and their special of the day - breakfast burrito to go.  After paying at the cashier, I wasnt instructed as to where to go so I just kind of hung around until I noticed there were orders coming out from the little coffee bar in the left corner.  

I waited......and waited.....and waited some more.....

After 35 minutes of waiting, finally I flagged down the manager and asked if my order would be coming out some time this year.  He apologized and said yes, that they had gotten ""like 600 orders right before"" I came in. 600? Me thinks not.  

When the order finally came out he said he threw in a few special things for us and apologized again.  Ok, sounds good.  However, when I got it home neither of the breakfast items we ordered had the sides they come with (fruit, biscuit) but there was 1 bran muffin thrown in. Gee thanks!

After that, it's all downhill.  We arrived when it was fairly busy to discover quite possibly the stupidest seating/ordering system ever conceived (and I've seen a lot).

First off, as you approach the front entrance, there are basically two-and-a-half lines.  One on the left, one on the right, and then a mass of confused people in the middle trying to understand the difference.  When you finally make your way up to earshot of the woman who is rudely yelling out that you are in the wrong line (as if you should know the system your first time there), you learn that the right hand line is for getting a table.  But not a normal table like you would have with a waiter.  A table ""reservation"".  You get a ticket with a number on it.  Or, if there's no tables ready at the moment (which was the case for us), you don't get a ticket.  You give her your name and then awkwardly stand around and wait to be called to be given a ticket.  (Yes there are 3 elements to be tracking now).  Then, once you are called to get a ticket, you are told to get in the left-hand line and that when you finally get to the front, you can order.  

(**Did I mention you're not allowed to order unless you have first waited on the list, and then waited in the right-hand line?  So some people accidentally waited in the left line only to reach the front and then be told they have to go get on the list to wait in line 1 to get a ticket to wait on line 2**) 

Once you order at the end of the left-hand line, you are told to ""go find your table"".  So you search around trying to match your number with the stand on one of the very many tables there.  Then, you sit down and wait for your food.  

If you want water, you can get it yourself from a 5 ounce dixie cup.  If you ask for a large plastic cup (which they have), you are told ""no, those are only for ice tea.""

If, perhaps, you decide you want to add a food item, order another latte, whatever --- wait for for --- you have to START THE WHOLE PROCESS OVER AGAIN.  Absurd.  

Add to all of this that the restaurant (which probably seats 150) has ONE COED BATHROOM.  Yes, you read that right.

This place needs to pump the brakes on the ordering logistics and just hire some waiters/servers and do it the old fashioned way that has worked for several centuries.  They tried to re-invent the wheel and ended up with a triangle.  Also, build another bathroom for the love of god.

While waiting for our lunch, I walked up to the display and see only two slices of carrot cake and ask, ""you have more carrot cake, right"", after all it is only lunchtime, but this guy tells me, No, that is it...so I am like thinking ok, well I really wanted 4 slices to go but I guess 2 slices will do and then as I stare at the carrot cake this guy informs me that although my eyes clearly are looking at two slices that only one slice is for sell because he has PRE-SOLD 1 of the 2 slices. 

Excuse me! I'm thinking if you pre-sale a slice you take it out of the display and put it in a box and put it aside, you don't leave it out for the next customer to come up to and start salivating over and drooling for after having heard from friends how great it is! 

So being totally speechless I walk away. Then I see the guy decide to now remove the one slice from the display. What's left is the end with extra frosting all around the side, so I go up to the cashier and order that very last slice and pay for it. 

Next thing I see is the guy go to get the slice for me. He must not have been working in kitchens long becuase he set the to-go container quite a ways away from the slice then took a knife and attempted to extract the single slice upright...only to have it topple over, frosting face down onto the counter-top, SPLAT!

Observation: good number of people inside, nice décor.
Naïve decision: must be decent.

When we entered, a server immediately asked us where we wanted to sit so she could put our number there. I thought that quite strange, because don't people usually get numbers AFTER ordering? In any case, we chose a table, then lined up to order. The menu neither varied nor impressive. I went for the American breakfast, and he went for the banana French toast. At the front of the line, one of the employees decided to open up the other register, and glared at us, then said, ""I can help you over here."" Really? Glare, then notify? 

While taking our order, she was straight up rude. She smugly asked what I wanted, asked if wheat bread was okay because that's the only type they serve--if I don't have an option, why are you even asking anyway? Then, I inquired whether the potatoes can be hash browns instead, and she gave me the dirtiest look ever, followed by a snarky, ""We don't do that here."" Well, EXCUSE ME.
Then she moved n to him. He asked what's popular there (just to verify his choice), and she curtly replied, ""Our banana French toast is good."" He said, ""Okay,"" but mid-word was cut off by her obviously saying by script, ""Oh! By the way... Our mimosas are buy one get one half off right now, if you guys are interested,"" and totally judged us for thinking about it and saying no. Obviously overwhelmed with disappointment, she then asked, ""Well, do you guys want anything to drink?"" Was just water not okay? Really? So we reluctantly ordered a large orange juice, assuming that for more than half the price of an entree, it would at least be fresh-squeezed. 

The ""large"" OJ came in a not-large-at-all mason jar. The jar idea was cute, but it did not distract me from the fact that the orange juice was clearly not fresh. It was probably Tropicana with low pulp or something. Don't get me wrong--I like Tropicana, but you don't pay like six bucks for a way-too-sweet orange juice at a supposedly 4-star bakery/ cafe. 
After a long, long time, our entrees finally arrived. His French toast looked like a sugar nightmare, and he said it was nothing out of the ordinary, meanwhile confirming the sweetness of the mess. Meanwhile, my American breakfast of eggs, ham, potatoes (thinly sliced ""chips,"" really), and toast (WHEAT, of course) was also nothing out of the ordinary. I kept trying to flag down one server's attention to request butter and jam, but each of my eight attempts was to no avail. But when the lady next to me tried to get her attention, she noticed her right away and got her jam and butter seconds thereafter. Of course.

It's not nearly as enticing once you get through the door. The decor is awfully outdated, the tables wobble, and the furniture is not-so-tastefully mismatched.

We spent 5 minutes in line before deciding that for-here patrons were supposed to find a seat before ordering. We spent another 2 minutes at the table before realizing we were wrong and got back into line -- at the end. The cashier/register asked me to tip before ordering, which was smart because I forked over a lot more than I would have otherwise. 

My Huevos Rancheros ($13?) were poorly prepared, with gritty beans, overdone eggs, and rough tortillas. My wife's biscuit was dry and her request for no tomatoes on her scramble was ignored ($11?). After picking at our food for 20 minutes, we walked to a cafe next door to fill up on pastries.

I ordered the crab omelette, and it immediately smelled fishy as the server approached the table with the dish.  This tells me the crab is not fresh.  They also paired it with a heavy pesto sauce, and shredded cheese, which is not melted at all.  This was a miss: a creamy dill or any sort of cream sauce would've cut the fishy flavor and complemented the crab.  But the pesto was just a weird match.  Even the biscuit was stale and tasteless (and I love biscuits).

The seating/ordering process is a frustrating and convoluted waste of time. Every time I had a visiting friend who wanted to eat here, I tried to steer them away. Aside from the ridiculous marathon that is ordering and securing a table, the food itself is way too expensive for what it is and the staff doesn't care one teensy little bit if you're satisfied with your meal or experience.

Example? On my most recent visit, I ordered the huevos rancheros without the salsa (since I can't eat tomatoes). When the dish arrived with tomatoes, I (very politely) told the server that I'd asked for it without salsa. He said ""it's just diced tomatoes, not salsa"" and then vanished, never to be seen from again.

I tried to ask someone else about fixing the ($15!) meal that I couldn't eat, but I got a couple shrugs and eventually gave up, since my friends were almost done eating and I didn't want to get back in that monster of a line just to re-order my food and delay everyone.

This is not acceptable to me. How do I know what the actual service would look like? The minimum suggested gratuity is 15%. Third, you would need to go to the counter and get water yourself.

You know what has not gone down are the prices.They have increased.  $21 for a small sandwich, small salad and Arnold Palmer? The chicken used to be moist and tender and the past 3 times I have ordered it it is dry. They changed the bread to something that tasted like cinnamon today and I had to add a lot of sauces that I had at work to make it taste okay. I have taken coworkers on two separate occasions to Jeannine's and the first time did not impress and the second time the server forgot to bring bread and gave my coworker the wrong meal.

The hotel staff had recommended it, the Yelp reviews were predominantly positive, and it was a short walk away. I came here with high expectations.

Jeannine's was certainly a nice (if a bit too cutesy) place but I wasn't wow-ed: 
-- Being a bakery, I was hoping for some fantastic scones (an old weakness). But Jeannine's had only very basic flavors (e.g. plain, blueberry, lemon) and the selection was the same every single day. I have come to expect more creativity than this. (local fruit? interesting combos?) But no. Yawn. I couldn't find one that appealed to me.
-- Many of their signature dishes rely on a slathering of hollandaise sauce, but I've just never been a fan (I'm a mutant, I know).  Plus it feels like cheating.
-- Prices are high here, yet food must be ordered at the counter (aka via a line). Seems like such a high-falutin' spot could afford some actual waitstaff.

That said, it wasn't terrible. My standard, two-egg breakfast used high-quality ingredients and was cooked just right. The setting was attractive, the coffee was good and the staff were reasonably friendly.  

The only food downside was the huevos rancheros special, which was super-boring and bland. (I switched back to the 2 egg breakfast on my third visit.)

He stuck a straw into the drink and pulled smoothie out to taste, he said it was the way it was supposed to taste so he wouldn't let me have anything in exchange. It got even worse when he said that if you go into a restaurant and order a steak, that you cannot exchange a steak if you don't like it. Let me just say that I worked in a restaurant and there is no limit to what people exchange, and if it's a good place, they will do the exchange to make there customer happy.

We dined here on a recent Sunday evening and were overall very disappointed. We started with 2 wine flights, but the server sped and mumbled his way through the descriptions so fast we couldn't understand a word. He also took the wine menu after we ordered, so we couldn't refer to them to see what we were drinking. But, the flights were reasonably priced and a good size pour, so that helped make up for the lack of flair with the service. We specified that we were going to share 2 appetizers, but they were served to each of us without any small plates for sharing the dishes. I asked him as he walked away for ""2 small plates"", he looked at me and then never returned.  The braised pork ravioli dish was excellent (a bit small for sharing, but delish). We also had the Carmelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tart which was served with baby greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. It was tasty but a bit overdone, as if it had been left under a heat lamp too long.  Everything was cleared away including the silverware, which wasn't replaced once our main dishes arrived. So frustrating! We had to grab new silverware from a nearby empty table.

For our mains, I ordered the Seared Californa Bass, which wasn't very seared at all but still managed to be over cooked. So disappointed to have dry fish in a restaurant, especially at $25 a plate. But, the polenta cake and ratatouille were both good. When I mentioned to our server that the fish was overcooked he said ""that's funny, it's usually UNDER cooked"". My husband ordered the Grilled NY Steak with Bleu Cheese Scented Croquette and Grilled Rapini. Whew....if that is a bleu cheese SCENTED croquette, I'd hate to taste a ""bleu cheese croquette"". I LOVE bleu cheese, especially with beef. But this was just too much warm, melty, rich cheese. We found no evidence of any potato. The rapini was just inedible, very very bitter and chewy. It was almost as if they cooked the part you're supposed to trim off and throw away. The beef was rich and tasty and a tad over coooked, but after all of the fat was cut away it didn't leave a very big portion. 

So, overall I felt that they had the ""B Team"" working on Sunday night. Service is a big part of the dining experience, and when the food also doesn't measure up, it just makes for a very disappointing over all experience. If the food was A+, we probably could have overlooked an apathetic and bored service staff.",2010-08-24 22:17:49

Neither soup we chose was available although there signs all over the counter advertising the soup. We finally had to go back up to the counter to ask how much longer and were told it was just being made then but they were out of spinach for the hummus power bowl.

We waited about 4 minutes at the podium before our server greeted us, and sat us on the patio. At 5:30 we were 1 of only 2 tables, but it took forever to place an order, and then our appetizers came out before our drinks. Helpful as our server tried to be, he was obviously lost (age or lack of training, who knows.) Still, as the sun began to dip behind the buildings on State, and as hotties and bums, families, farmers and freaks all happily converged upon each other in a typical Santa Barbara one-love, its all good state-of-mind, time didn't seem to matter.

Everything was fresh and made to order. The Caesar was a lovely salad comprised of a quarter head of crisp romaine with plenty of cheese, well-dressed and served with two large crouton slices of bread.

I ordered the braised short ribs which were served on a bed of grilled corn and Kale with fingerling potatoes and roasted garlic. Just a touch too salty, the dish was still very good and all the flavors married well.

My wife's Chicken Scallopini was also served with fingerling potatoes as well as roasted garlic, capers, mushrooms, white wine, lemon juice and a generous amount of melted Mozzarella. I was impressed by how well the wine, lemon and garlic still kept their individual flavors, while creating the prerequisite sauce for the dish.

Dessert was a well executed rice pudding with bananas and pistachios which I ordered to go.

While the food was good, one last disappointment was that while sitting on the patio looking into the restaurant's large glass windows, I couldn't help but notice the several dead winged termites, an old half-used sugar packet and an accumulation of salt and pepper along the interior window sill.

Always

It is very apparent a few employees work hard and show up while others ride their coat tails
The space is nice

I was in the restaurant business from the time I was 9. Shucking oysters. Bussing. Dishes. It's a great work experience I just wish the staff looked happier.

Behaviors that I believe are a liability
Know I am tough

Restaurants and cafes. Coffee houses and diners 
Are places that are supposed to offer comfort and nourishment to the body and soul
We seek these places after hard days and long nights to replenish us. But when I see an employee being yelled at or insulted by staff or management.  It hurts my heart. Sadly Panera helps put the C in Corporate. Too bad. It could d beastly be a community oasis instead of "" the lesser of two evils "" or "" the only choice""
The staff would be happier The customers

I was craving pasta as usual, and wanted to eat the Lobster Putanesca I enjoyed at Pierre Lafond last time. Unfortunately, it was no longer on the menu.

I opted for the Shrimp Pappardelle with roasted mushrooms, asparagus and shellfish cream. I really had high hopes for this dish, but it came swimming in sauce. You could have called it shrimp stew and it would have been more fitting. As far as asparagus goes, I found about 5 small cut up pieces in there. The rest was pasta, shrimp, tomatoes and some mushrooms. What a waste at $21. 

My dining companion had the Mushroom Sacchetti Pasta with roasted mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and asparagus in a light Chardonnay sauce and it was pretty much 80% sun dried tomatoes. The pasta was very dense and cheesy, and the sauce was anything but light. There should have been more than 5 small pieces of asparagus to balance out the forest of sun dried tomatoes. $18 for this, I think not.

As far as service goes, it was mehhhh at best. We were greeted by the host after waiting for a few minutes at the front. The waiter seemed inexperienced and in a rush to hurry us out. Why? The restaurant wasn't even that busy! One such instance that perturbed me was when he came up to ask me if I was done eating, while I was in MID BITE! Ummm, hello? Does it LOOK like I'm done? Geeez. 

This brings me to another thing I've noticed lately about restaurants  trying to rush you out. Please don't do that. It makes me feel unimportant and that you just care about your next guests. Also, it discourages me from wanting to return or recommend you to others. 

In conclusion, skip Pierre Lafond. There are several better dining options on State Street.

She didn't present the cork, and when she poured, she spilled a lot (and I'm not exaggerating) on the white table cloth.  We had to ask for new wine glasses, and tell her we'd pour the wine ourselves for the rest of our meal.

They recommended Pierre Lafond Wine Bistro. We headed over and grabbed a seat on the patio. The heat-lamps were on, so we were very comfortable. We started off with two glasses of the Zin (which was very good for the price point-$8.00). Then we tried the vegetarian chili which was excellent. We then ordered two turkey burgers. One with no bun and a salad, and one with a bun and  salad. Our waiter brought out my wife's turkey burger (alone) and as he placed it on the table I said: ""That's strange that you only have one burger and not mine."" The waiter replied: ""Yes it is, let me go check what happened in the kitchen."" Since I did not feel it right that my wife's food get cold, we both decided that she should start her meal. We waited 14 minutes and finally a food runner brought out my turkey burger. Our waiter?? No idea where he disappeared to. We both figured that he was embarrassed by his mistake and just did not want to show his face again. Which he was successful in doing. He did NOT show up again over the next 20-25 mins as we finished our turkey burgers and wine. He did finally show up to drop off the check as move on. There was not apology for what just happened. No explanation. Nothing. As he came by to pick up my credit card, my wife explained: ""We don't feel it's right that you never showed up again after you dropped off the first burger. We weren't even given an explanation by you as to what happened. We'd like you to take something off of our check."" The waiter proceeded by taking off our chili. BUT, we had to be the one's to ask.

Ordered the Chia Seed Bowl (like oatmeal), Toast, and French Toast.

The French Toast was not well done at all. Tasted simply like a cinnamon roll with fake jam on it.

Kitchen:
It feels as if the kitchen is shared with their bar next door and so the Breakfast that we had did not have a taste of clean morning food. It felt more like a bar food. Despite them trying to make it look super healthy.

Overall the taste of the food, quality, and gut feel on cleanliness was poor.

My mussel plate on the other hand was like I had seen in a previous post here, Inedible . It was like so over powering with tomatoes and chorizo and salt, I could not finish it. it was like the cook thought they were doing me a favor and adding all they had from the bottom of the kettle.
I should have sent it back but my niece was so proud to take me there,I said nothing.
So this is why I write now.
From my view the plates need to be made with a much more subtle hand and sense. More will never be better in cooking ! The chorizo was too much and not really the best quality ,it was like cubed summer sausage ! one could not even taste the mussels!

I came here for the first [and clearly my last] time over the 4th of July weekend with four close girlfriends in tow.

Oh, and maybe a bruschetta platter as a starter and some spring rolls.  Oh, and we apologize in advance for submitting such a complicated order.  Do forgive us.

Riddle me this: Why in the hell did it take an HOUR to deliver 5 salads?  Seriously.  And why on god's good earth did our waitress refuse to acknowledge the long wait for our food or even cordially say goodbye to us after we got up and left and try to apologize for all of the hassle we experienced?  Why didn't she say that the apps and all of our beverages and my salad, which were all magically left off of our final bill, were actually taken off cogniscently as an effort on her part, a make-good, if you will?  Instead of feeling comfortable and at ease, my party and I felt alienated and bullied throughout our entire meal.

Maybe our stunningly good looks intimidated her?  Perhaps our oozing charisma and San Francisco intelligence convinced her that she was a lesser being?

Our server said it was just cheese, marinara sauce and sausage.  Since my husband tends to be allergic to certain foods we went with that because of the lack of ingredients.

I have been wanting to check this place out for quite some time as it appears to have an intimate yet fun atmosphere. So a few weeks ago my friend LM and I went for dinner and wine while we caught up with one another. 

We were sat inside near the window, great for people watching those on State Street. Our server came by promptly to take our orders. To start, we each ordered the Around the World flights of wine and the Farmer's Market Tomato and Arugula Pesto Flatbread to share. The wine was great. The flatbread seemed a bit burnt and tasted blah. We also each ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup which was delicious.

The thing that ruined the experience was the service. Shortly after ordering our soups, the soft Jazz-y music stopped and Lil' Wayne started blasting from the speakers. My friend and I were shocked, as this did not seem as such an establishment, especially to play the unedited version of some songs. We were confused but tried to ignore it and resume our meal. Few songs later, the regular music was back on. Our server also disappeared for a while during our time at the restaurant, and once he reappeared he seemed stoned and was behaving unprofessionally; hiccuping and laughing randomly... in general just being awkward.

The result was a big glob of meat in one corner of the sandwich...  I literally had to disassemble my sandwich and re-make it at my table so that I could eat it.  Should a customer EVER have to do that?  

Go to South Coast Deli, Panini, Nortons, Three Pickles or even VONS deli for a much, much, much better sandwich!!!!!  We are so lucky to live in a town with so many great choices for a wonderful sandwich.",2012-03-24 15:43:53

The rapini that came to the table was almost inedible because it seems they must take the raw rapini toss it on the grill for 5 minutes and serve...WRONG.

Step 1. Blanch in boiling water 1-2 minutes and then remove to ice water.
Step 2. Squeeze out excess water with a kitchen towel.
Step 3. Slice some garlic, heat some olive oil in a saute pan and toss in some garlic and some chile flakes and barely brown garlic.
Step 4. Toss in rapini add a bit more oil and season with S&P. Heat high once you put in rapini.
Step 5. Eat rapini that actually has some flavor.

GOT IT BRO?

As for the rest. 

Iceberg Wedge -  fine but the quality of everything on the dish was equal to a chain restaurant.

Lobster Putanesca - Pretty freekin bad.

NY Steak - yes it did taste like a steak, the rapini was (see above) and the potato thingy was fair, i would rather have good fries or plain mashed.

Farm Cake - Are you kidding me...the only thing missing was the Drakes rapper.  Overly sweet flavorless cake...yum. If you want to see what real bake goods should taste like go to D'Angelo's.",2010-09-19 23:03:09

The last 3 or 4 times I've been in this location my carry out order is usually not ready (quoted 10 minutes and I show up at the 15 minute mark). In addition, no one behind the counter in the carry out line acknowledges your existence. Anywhere from 2 to 5 employees will walk by you, not say a word, and then maybe a couple minutes later decide to ask if you are picking up an order. 
This morning in particular, the girl behind the counter that was ""helping"" me had a scowl on her face and an attitude while asking me what I was there to pick up. The management needs to do some serious re-evaluation of who they choose to hire and how they are training their employees. Having a friendly smile and GREETING A CUSTOMER go a long way. A simple ""hi, welcome! Give me a minute and I'll be right with you"" makes a world of difference. It acknowledges the person and let's them know they are actually valued.

Enter: Pierre Lafond. A charming French bistro ocated on the busy and popular State Street, AKA  drunk street for UCSB students.

We waited for 5 minutes before being seated on the patio. I noticed that service was pretty damn slow. I'm not sure why, but based on other people's reviews, that seems to be normal here.

We order 2 bellinis, lobster putanesca for me and salmon club sandwich for him. 

Bellinis were standard, but hit the spot. I mean, gave me tingles in my head. 

Lobster putanesca was good, except for the lobster itself. Booo. It was too hard an chewy. I did like the angel hair pasta and the sauce though. 

S had to send his sandwich back because the bacon was not cooked fully. He likes bacon crispy and not fatty like it came. Can't blame him!

We had another bellini each to finish off the meal! 

Overall, I'd come back. But, I would order something different, along with a mimosa next time. 

Side note: An artist was sitting behind me and sketched a caricature of us. It was a cute touch to lunch, although he just got my back,  but it still looks like me! Didn't really look like S' face though. Oh wells. It was Easter, so we bought it off him for $10.

Goat cheese and carmalized onion tart, served with argula and lemon balsalmic -- best dish of the day. The greens nicely complimented the sweetness of the tart. Yum.

BBQ Salmon BLT on grilled sourdough -- while this sounded interesting, it was only OK. The salmon was cooked well and anything tastes good with bacon and mayo, but it was just forgettable.

We do it when we don't have time to cook a healthy meal for ourselves in the middle of our workday. The food is almost always consistent and pretty good and the cookies and bread are delicious. But the service is so horrible at this location every single time we have gone and believe me we have given it many many many chances. There is definitely something wrong with the morale there and I can't understand it because if you go right next-door to chipotle you will notice a huge difference. The employees at the chipotle right next-door are always happy welcome mean and just simply fun to talk to. Literally every single time we got into Panera bread the people who work behind the counter seem to absolutely hate what they're doing and hate people coming in. We actually heard them arguing today with someone who had paid for two lattes and they only made one of them and argued with the person that they had not paid for two without looking at the receipt and then finding that they did in fact pay for two. They don't speak out so you can't hear them well when they're asking you questions and you have to ask them over and over again and we are not old by the way. My husband said the name of the breakfast sandwich he was ordering and the woman gave them a snotty reply back saying we have a lot of breakfast sandwiches which ones do you want to which he said the exact name of the one over again. To which she said in a snotty tone oh. The time before this last that I was there I was waiting for a take-out order and was watching all of the food pile up in pileup at the service station and no one coming to pick it up to put on the tables for others. There were several suits that were sitting there long enough that they were probably not cold anymore. The person plating everything kept asking for someone to help them and take everything out to the tables but no one was showing up to help. Then I watched two people go off shift and walk right past the food just to rush out of work making it very clear that they don't care very much about their jobs are the people there it's simply about picking up a paycheck and leaving and doing is mediocre of a job as you can possibly do for a paycheck. Anyway this is definitely a different and much worse atmosphere and the places near it and we are going to finally stop going there now. I think 10 chances is certainly enough,2017-05-25 16:53:19

The staff and the coffee were 5 stars. I couldn't have asked for a better barista than Andie. The chalkboard with the cold brews was fully stocked everyday with an amazing variety of coffees and lattes. I religiously went to rebar every morning for my coffee. A couple of weeks back I was pretty busy for a few days and maybe missed 3 days of going to rebar. Which was a lot for me. When I returned back I had noticed a couple things. One the chalkboard was completely empty besides one coffee. And I had also heard the 3 staff members who had been there forever were all no longer working there. Im not opposed to new staff even though I was sad to hear the old staff was gone. But the new staff is just completely clueless. When I saw the chalkboard walk completely empty, I asked for a simple Iced coffee with some vanilla in it. The girl gave me an iced coffee with this thick goopy syrup in it that would NOT stir into my drink. So every sip was just bites of a thick sugary syrup. Fair to say it was disgusting. I have never seen a place go from such high standards to what they are now so quickly. I walked in the other day hoping maybe just maybe they started filling up the chalkboard again and might be back to having the delicious cold brew vanilla lattes but yet again a completely empty chalkboard. This time I decided to just walk out. Sad to say but I can not see myself going back there. It is just not what it used to be.

He asked for another apple since we ordered two meals. Also when the staff member handed the bag over it ripped and a new bag was not offered. 
When my husband arrived home with our meal I saw my modern caprese sandwich was nothing but two pieces of bread with barely nothing in between them. My salad which I choose from the online menu because of it not having any meat, had chicken on it.   
His salad was perhaps a half of a half order, which we did the pick two but I have never seen them give such a small serving.

I leave this review mainly in the hopes that the owner will see it and give it some consideration.

Let's start with the positive then, nicely decorated and the picnic benches on the covered patio are great for beautiful Santa Barbara weather.

The problems start by them not offering decaf. Not everyone can tolerate caffeine, especially in the afternoons. I've never ever been to a place that did not at least offer a decaf Americano. It feels like coffee snobbery. 

Also, they charge .75 cents extra for non-dairy milk. Given the extreme drought of California,  they should charge .75 cents for cows milk given that animal products, including their excretions, are so detrimental to the environment. I'd totally have supported them had they no surcharge for non-dairy milk. Even if you don't care about the environment, again, not everyone can tolerate dairy so don't penalize us. There's an amazing coffee house in Mammoth that does not charge extra for non dair milk and when I asked why, they said, they wanted their customers to get their coffee crafted the way they wanted without regard to price. Well done Black Velvet Coffee in Mammoth Lakes!

I actually had wanted to buy a $25 gift card as a thank you for a friend who is a coffee lover, but ended up getting it from Handlebar instead. Yes, they also irritatingly charge for non-dairy milk, but at least they offer decaf. I want Rebar to succeed so I hope they will take these comments into consideration. If so, I'll be delighted to update my review.",2016-04-25 02:02:52

My wife and I popped in to Cafe Ana and were immediately charmed by the tasteful decor and layout of the space. We assumed the food would be on the same level, but sadly, it was not! We ordered the chicken soup, the patty melt, and the tomato bisque soup, and I thought the patty melt and the bisque were decent. The chicken soup was subpar and we felt the included veggies were frozen veggies they just dropped in last minute. 

That all being said, it would've been okay if the meal was ~$20. But it was $36, and we thought it was ridiculously overpriced for what it was. I'm sure other patrons will feel the same way, and I don't think Cafe Ana will be successful with its dining offering if it does not adjust pricing very soon. There's no way to leave feeling like you got your money's worth. Either step up the food quality drastically, or reduce prices 30% or so.

When I do go, I enter with a preconceived notion that the offerings have been vetted by the customers and therefore are the best choices available. 
That was my first mistake. 
I looked and my meatless choices for breakfast were limited to oatmeal, one of the salivating-worthy sugar bomb sweet offerings, oatmeal or an egg and cheese panini. 
I chose the latter. 
That was my second mistake. 
After a few minutes I got a flat, sad sandwich on the edge of a long white plate. 
Somehow, there was no flavor whatsoever, no condiments, nothing but bread flattened in a sandwich press, an egg or two and a slice of a white cheese. I couldn't tell what kind of cheese b/c it was devoid of any flavor. 
I got up and asked for salsa and was given the choice of Tabasco or pico de gallo. 
Somehow that was flavorless too.

Upon placing our orders, the gentleman taking the orders NEVER once warned us of a time restriction of which they impose a heavy ""close exactly at 9"" policy. We ordered and proceeded to go pick up our order. When it was 8:50 we were super close and so I phoned in just to let them know we would be there soon.

And I don't say this lightly, because your girl LOVES Panera. I grew up on their Mac & Cheese and soup with one barely 2 minutes from my house. So it hurts my heart to diss Panera, but unfortunately the astounding incompetence that we experienced today has forced my hand. 

Buckle up y'all.

So we get there at 6 PM. Prime dinner time. I get it. When we walk in, there's an enormous line, which probably should have been our first clue that things were about to go awry. But we thought, it's fine, they probably all came around the same time as us anyways. As the line crept onwards, it occurred to me that things were happening a little slower than was normal for Panera, but the thought left me when we reached the cashier. I ordered a You Pick 2, a soup and a mac & cheese; two of my friends also ordered a You Pick 2 to share and a smoothie, and another friend ordered a chicken noodle soup. The cashier seemed nice enough (I had no idea what was coming, rest in peace). 

We were a party of six, so we sat at a big table in the middle of the Panera. It was then that I realized that we didn't have a number stand to put on the table, so I asked my friend to go back and get one for us. She disappeared for a rather long time, returning with teas for her parents, but no number. I asked her what had happened, and she told me that the cashier had said that they knew what number we were, and would deliver our food accordingly. Odd, but not criminalizing. I returned to socializing, only to be interrupted by a waitress asking us if a plate was our order. And then another. And another. 25 minutes in, and we had received none of our orders while being asked whether at least five were ours. I was flabbergasted. What did our cashier mean, they knew what number we were? Did they know any of the other numbers that were sitting on the other guests' tables??

Given that half an hour had passed, I went to the cashier to ask him to check on our order. He apologized, took our receipt, and then vanished. About ten minutes pass, and he's just gone. I see other workers walking back and forth, but nothing on our receipt. It isn't until I grab my friend and SHE flags him down again that he asks what's wrong. We ask him about our order, and he says it's coming. Tries to leave again. We demand our receipt, and he rummages about before finally returning it. Tries to leave AGAIN. I ask how long we have to wait for our orders, and he says 5-10 minutes. 

At last, our food arrives and, as the cashier (now our waiter) places the trays on our table, I have to try really hard not to laugh. My plate looks somewhat normal, but my friends' mac & cheese looks as if, no joke, someone had taken three small spoons of it and dumped it onto just the left side of their plate. When I try my food, it's barely lukewarm. Granted, I love my food piping hot and consider many restaurant-plated foods cold, but this was actually cold. My soup had been heated like La Croix, as if the chef had very gently whispered HOT next to my room-temperature meal. But I was too hungry to care, so I ate. 

It wasn't until I was halfway done that I noticed that my other friend still hadn't gotten her soup. So, once again, I flagged down the waiter. It takes a few tries to get him to understand my request and then he tells us that the chicken noodle soup has run out. Surprise!!!! As if this wasn't something to bring to our attention earlier, the 3-4 times that we've already spoke with him. I'm absolutely furious, but I hold it in. He asks us, after a very long pause, whether we'd like a refund, and my friend spits, ""Of course! And I'd also like my smoothie."" 

In the end, we finally got our smoothie, my friends got Chipotle to make up for their poor food turnout, and my friend's mom went to argue for our refund (which the waiter didn't put through, apparently). Once again, we waited at least 20 minutes before we were able to get the refund and a $15 certificate in apology. My friend's mom also said, although this is hearsay, that she could see the manager just hanging out behind a counter, refusing to handle her case until 15 minutes had passed. When we finally left, it was almost 7:30, and my friend and I were late to a get together we'd planned earlier in the week. 

I understand that we got compensation, and that this review may seem petty, but I'm still livid and want others to at least know that something like this can happen at this location. I'm never coming back ever again. I'll get my mac & cheese at a more competent Panera, thanks.",2019-03-03 09:04:03

I just started dining here again after taking off probably almost a year because of the same issues. Problem is not getting the food I order. For example, yesterday I ordered to go the You Pick 2: tomato soup and the turkey, avocado and bacon sandwich. Open up my sandwich and it's some turkey panini. Today, I ordered the exact same thing and asked the counter person who took the order to make sure that she orders the right sandwich. She even reiterated what was in the sandwich so I thought, great I'll get it this time. Received my order, looked in the bag and noticed the croutons that come with the soup weren't there so I had to ask for it, but didn't check my sandwich. Open it up at work and the sandwich was mostly right, except the bacon is missing. Not sure why it's so hard to get it right. This store definitely needs some training and quality control.

Until now I have never met an ice tea I couldn't drink but it was gut wrenchingly bad. I figured a place that cannot get something as simple as ice tea right is a miserable failure. The premises were nice and clean but what someone did to this drink is a crime against humanity. It is entirely too much trouble to back track, find a parking place and demand my money back, so live and learn, but my stomach is still reacting as if it wants to rid itself of this noxious concoction.

I have not been to Panera back east. I assumed people who have, come to ours because it is familiar and reminds them of another place. 

Maybe the Paneras back east are different. A few people have implied as much. 

Drinks and pastries are about the same quality as a Starbucks. Not bad. Some nice enough. But not great. (Realize, this city is full of Peet's and CB&TL, plus awesome independent pastry shops and cafés, boasting top notch sweets and java.)

So, think quality like Starbucks...but will be crowded and no super perky staff, and you will sit at a sort of Denny's style table or booth in a very well lit but bland atmosphere. 

Food matches the atmosphere. Not bad at all, but just ok. In fact, if Starbucks did serve meals, I think they might be like this. 

Why go here? Well... it is in a very popular shopping center so you might want to get some coffee during your day. The center has lots of parking, and you can grab lunch with coffee. 

The Starbucks in this center is tiny, very limited seating, whereas  Panera is large and you likely will be able to sit right away. It is family friendly if you have kids. 

They have a loyal following. I have been there a few times because friends wanted to go. Staff was pleasant though busy, as there is a huge volume of people to serve. 

Nothing really wrong with my drink or food. Clean environment. 

Three stars because it is clean and consistent. And nothing really bad about it.

Cafe Ana is a really cute place with a wonderfully designed interior. We went in on a Saturday for brunch, so it was a bit crowded. It was kind of confusing when you first walk in. They have a counter to order at with menus but you can only order food at the tables and there was a wait for the food tables but plenty of seating elsewhere. One side of the cafe is just for coffee and drinks, the other side is for sit down food. Kitchen is small so I think they weren't able to keep up with the amount of people coming in. We counted 40 empty seats as we were sitting there waiting to be seated to order food and there were plenty of seats in the ""coffee and drinks"" section but they wouldn't let us order food there. A sign might help with that confusion like ""please wait to be seated"" or something. It ended up taking an hour for us to get seated. The wait for our food wasn't terrible but still about 20-30 min. So it took us an hour and half from the time we walked in to the time we saw a plate of food. We were starving. 

Speaking of food, it was okay. I ordered the prosciutto and egg sandwich and then they told me they ran out of prosciutto but could substitute sausage. The flavor of the sausage was very overpowering and clashed with the aioli. My fiancé got the salmon scramble and said it was ok but that he was too hungry to really tell. We ordered the bakery basket and that actually had some really good bread and biscuits. Definitely recommend trying the cheddar chive biscuit. 

 Despite the long wait and everything, everyone that works there was super nice! They just need a new system. Long term this system or small kitchen won't work. You have people coming in seeing a bunch of empty tables but being told there is a 30 minute wait to be seated, that looks terrible. I really want this place to succeed because I'm a sucker for a cute cafe/restaurant and Sb needs more of them. They opened up about a month ago, so fingers crossed they work out a better system.",2019-01-16 03:08:09

I've enjoyed ordering from their breakfast menu - Ingredients are fresh, often made from scratch, and thoughtfully prepared (getting that perfectly cooked egg is no easy task!) The portions are pretty generous and the presentation is beautiful.

Update:
I really wanted to give them 4-5 stars however a few days after writing the above review, they completely changed their breakfast menu. Theyve now downgraded their breakie sandwiches in terms of portion and no longer offer any of the original sandwiches. They've basically stripped out ingredients AND increased the price by a whopping $5!!!  The Avocado is now not included (which was why I loved this sandwich so much) So I'm paying more for less? Ordering the same sandwich I was used to getting costs nearly $15 vs $10! That's just bacon and eggs, folks! Feels really off. Not sure if you think paying $15 for an egg sandwich with some bacon or ham is worth it - But this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Pretty disappointing!!",2020-02-13 06:35:25

I came in opening week and ordered a soup (which wasn't marked on the menu properly and was twice as expensive as stated). The soup had absolutely no flavor and the chicken in it was undercooked. I realize that chicken can be darker depending on what part of the body the chicken is from. Well this wasn't dark chicken it was actually bloody. I got food poisoning from the amount of it that I choked down before realizing it wasn't cooked through. Then I tried to email the staff and just let them know what happened to avoid this review. Well they emailed me back and told me I was wrong. So here I am writing this review. I highly recommend walking a block or two extra and finding a place with better food and better service.

I was extremely disappointed by this concha. The pink sugar topping was done right, but the bun was basically a wheat roll. That is NOT my idea of a concha.

The coffee urns are empty, one girl ran 4 bagels through the machine and they all landed on the floor! The bathrooms are disgustingly dirty for a food establishment, light bulbs are burned out, cobwebs in the corners, smeared little fingerprints on the windows, sticky tables and chairs, the cashier area is dusty and they never have a pen to sign your receipt, it's so painful! What happened to the mellow tunes playing in the background and someone checking your table to see if everything is ok or if you needed anything? Customer service is really important when you want good reviews. The turnover rate of staff is really impressive as well. Today we waited in line at least 15 minutes, 2 cashiers, 8+ people in line, it took 20 minutes to even get our food, take it back.. it sat on the counter for about 10 minutes, couldn't wait any longer so I got out of my chair to GET MY OWN FOOD! No one even questioned it, even the patrons waiting for their to go orders were laughing. Even the little old lady and her hunchback husband got their own food, then the poor thing had to get back up and ask for a napkin!  Seriously, where's the staff? Um, orders are up and waiting...WHERE'S THE MANAGER? HIRE GOOD HELP PANERA! Raise your wages if you have to to keep your staff! Everyone (the few) looks busy, they look
frazzled. Your patrons are hungry and want efficiency! If the cashiers have 8+ people in line, they need to ask for help, get that manager out there and start taking orders!

After breakfast, I went to the bathroom with my wallet and accidentally left my wallet in the restaurant after I finished up the breakfast. After leaving, I realized 20 minutes later that I left the wallet so I ran back inside to check in the bathroom (I happened to have a lot of cash in there). I looked around in both bathrooms, under the toilet, inside the trashcan, and checked every inch of both bathrooms (even though I knew EXACTLY which bathroom I used). I walked around the block, to see if someone just stole the cash and chucked the wallet outside, so I circled the block 2 times. At that point, I walked home (since I live fairly close) and filed a police report, and froze my cards. After doing that, I came back to search around more, talked to the staff and gave them my contact information, and told them I filed a police report just to be transparent with them. 20 MIN LATER I GET A CALL FROM THEM. They call me saying they found it in the bathroom? Hmmm. Very suspicious. I went back, they handed me my wallet, but all the cash was stolen. 

I'm not saying they stole the cash, I'm just saying it was very convenient that it just happened to show up IN THE BATHROOM 20 min after I already checked.

I feel bad because with the flavor choices they boast (you should see their website for a full listing), I really, really wanted to like these...... and I didn't.  I read every single review, and I thought I was going to swoon over these little cupcakes, but I didn't.    :-(

First of all, I found them inside a place called the Santa Barbara Public Market, and I loved the ambience of that place (see separate review for that), but when I stumbled onto the area where Enjoy Cupcakes is located, I almost walked right by.  I was looking for a bunch of cupcakes.  What I found was a small counter with 4 glass containers with about a dozen of whatever flavors were in them.  They were offering 6, as they only do each day.......  and not all 6 were even out.  Just 4.  If you wanted all six, they were in a small carton.  I was stuck on the fact that there were only 6 flavors for the day, and I asked.... that is all they ever offer.  (Remember that scene in A Fish Called Wanda where Kevin Kline's character opens the safe in the garage and does NOT see the diamonds, and he yells out, ""Disappoinnnnnntedddddddddd"" ???  That's how I felt.)

Their website claims the following........""590 Cupcake flavors to date, while continually experimenting & adding more.""  Then, they list the flavors, and while I haven't counted them, I have no idea if it shows 590 flavors, but it's one amazingly long list.  So, I wasn't expecting 590 flavors.... but certainly about 20.  All I got was 6, and at that, I felt like the whole thing was just too controlled and fixed.  They were so small that I wasn't going to leave without the 6 offered, but I definitely left there feeling cheated.  They offered some refrigerated pudding (2 choices of that), but I wasn't going home right away and didn't want that sitting in the car.

So we get home, split the 6 cupcakes in 1/2, which is difficult to do with such small cupcakes, but we do it...... and that way, both my husband and I can share.  I didn't even finish mine.  I didn't like the texture...... cake a bit too heavy for my liking, and I didn't like the icing.  I just wasn't tasting the flavors, and on one of them, perhaps it was the cupcake with the syrah wine, ewwwwwwwwww, that just tasted bad to me.  The others, nothing special, and with the titles they were given, I expected powerhouse flavors going on.  Didn't happen.

I gave 2 stars out of guilt..... being the only one thus far to speak ill of them.  I just didn't want to be too harsh.  I've tried many cupcakes in my time, and these just didn't rate.  Sorry.",2014-07-13 08:04:02

The coffee is Organic and they sell it by the bag. I've had a couple different lattes there, black coffee and iced and none of them did it for me.

After being handed the cupcakes, I asked if they had little cards to note the flavors for presentation - ""no, we are all out, they are all online"" rather than offering to note them or to provide a piece of paper. It was within the first twenty minutes of opening, so these are not regularly supplied.

I asked if they have anything to help present for a birthday, and he pulled out a single small candle and said it is all they do and that I could go to CVS. 

After ordering the two sets I got an extra cupcake for myself, which was charged at full rate as if purchasing a single cupcake only. Not so concerned about the small savings for bulking bulk but curious about the principle of that, I asked why the rate isn't congruent with the discount I received for ordering two sets if I got an extra one - ""no one has ever complained about that"". Four for cupcakes and zero for customer service. 

Be advised to not stop in there if you are looking to pick up a simple, minimally tailored gift for a birthday without notifying the day/s before - they are not prepared to provide any options like one would reasonably expect a cake shop to have.

I had the Atlantic Salmon and substituted my rice for extra vegetables. The salmon looked and tasted sub par and my vegetables were all boiled unseasoned carrots and maybe one or two pieces of asparagus. My uncle had the Fettuccini Alfredo, that was a giant portion, definitely promoting obesity.

We ordered our drinks (they do have a couple of good beers on tap) and waited. And waited. Did I mention we waited? We finally walked up to the bar and asked for our drinks, which were finally brought to us by some other worker besides our server. 

We got our food, which I will say the fries were really tasty. My friend ordered a medium well burger and it came out after asking for it again (which it really seemed like they just forgot to put it in at all). It was rare. So rare that it was mooing and leaving a bloodied plate. So gross. So we had to send it back for another. And we waited. Waited. Waited some more. We finally told them to cancel it because we were done waiting. 

Everything would have been fine if someone could have communicated with us, admitted an error, offered us a beer while we wait. Somehow acknowledged that they were really off on their game. But they didn't. 

When we were ready to pay, we had to track someone down; mind you we were sitting 5 feet from the cash register. Everything was a chore for the customer here, it was no a pleasant experience. I could also see a table outside complaining as well, so we weren't alone.

After paying her she was rude when I mentioned she didn't provide with one of the empanadas and instead of trying at all to fix the situation she raised her voice and got upset with me and I ended up leaving without the rest of my order because she admitted she messed up but then wanted to charge me more for the next empanada when the price written down was less. It was the lady with the blonde hair and turquoise contacts that got defensive and rude from the start. The man that works there is so friendly and she completely ruined the experience.

The location is great, the food was good, service was awful.

We were seated outside right away, but it took more than 5 minutes for our server to come over. (I think it was at least 10 but since I wasn't timing it I don't want to possibly exaggerate.) It was long enough for us to decide on what we were eating and read enough Yelp reviews that we started to consider leaving. (Should have checked Yelp before, like I usually do!)

The waitress came over apologizing. We ordered a soy mocha, a grilled chicken sandwich and the crab quesadilla.

The mocha came out and it tasted like chocolate flavored water. Really gross. I wanted to trade it in for an Iced Tea. We kept looking for our server and she was nowhere to be found. There were only a few tables and it was right during the lunch hour, which should have been our clue that this was a place to avoid. There were employees everywhere but not our server. I finally asked another employee if she could send our server over.

And we waited some more. We were actually deciding to leave when our food came out. So we started eating. My grilled chicken sandwich was good, the fries were good but greasy. My husband thought his crab quesadilla tasted like tuna.

We were almost done with our food when our server finally decided to grace us with her presence. I told her to please take off the barely touched mocha and to just bring the check, which she did.

There's no reason the service should have been that bad, they were not understaffed. There is a reason they were so empty during the Friday lunch hour, and management should take note.

7Ymx_eZG_HoAt1kMDgMVDw,0aplD_vsJkLPSrEuX4V2TQ,CwL56LgcMz7Bvi4xODHVSw,1,0,0,0,"I wish one of my favorite breakfast spots in SB had been open today. Being that it is New Years, I had to settle on trying out La Arcada Bistro for the first time. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a mistake. My girlfriend and I are not hard to please by any means, but this place just did all they could to dissatisfy us. 

I would not recommend this spot to anyone. And, I will not return. There are just too many great places in Santa Barbara. Read on to hear how my experience went, if you are interested. 

First off, when I try a new place, I definitely go into it with an open mind, but there are a few things I expect from any restaurant as basic give-ins. My philosophy is simple. I go by the three strike rule. Service, food quality, over-all feeling. If the place gets three strikes, then that is it. I mean, I get that there are times when you have an ""off"" experience, but if the place strikes out, then there is something wrong at the core of the business. (In my opinion.)

La Arcada Bistro struck out. The service was poor (one example- I had to ask three different people over a 10 minute period of time for more [over-priced, barely warm, poor quality] coffee. This is a basic part of the service one pays for when going out to eat, and an easy one at that. If the server is trying hard, might be busy, the place could be understaffed, and I get that. However, this was not the case here. It came down to laziness, lack of attentiveness, and just plain disregard for a basic skill. Yes- basic. I have served in many atmospheres in the restaurant industry. I speak from experience. Refilling beverages is simple, and any service-oriented business should be proficient at the easy basic things.) Strike two was the poor quality of food, especially related to the prices. Breakfast is one of the easiest meals to prepare. If you are charging $10 for pancakes, they should be special in some way. I got two small pancakes that had less flavor than the cardboard that the box of mix they undoubtedly used came in. Strike three, overall feeling, came when my girlfriend found some hair in her lack-luster french toast breakfast. I asked the server if this was typical of their food, and when she assured me it wasn't I told her that my girlfriend had lost her appetite. The server offered no apologies and did not attempt to rectify the situation. This as I am sure you all know, is a major service blunder. Not only did the server reflect poorly on her own skills, but more importantly, the business itself. Needless to say, I will not recommend this place to anyone, and will on the contrary steer anyone who asks away from this business. I am a very reasonable consumer, but three strikes and I am done. I won't be surprised if La Arcada Bistro is out of business before the Spring. 

I am a solution oriented person, so if you are looking for a good place to have breakfast and find yourself near this one, there are several right there that are far better: The Andersen, Jeannine's, and State & Fig are three places in La Arcada that blow the ""Bistro"" out of the water. Do yourself a favor and try one of them instead.",2013-01-01 23:45:33

It was New Year's Eve before our symphony and we had to find a place to eat. We waited longer then we should have and ended up here because we just kept walking toward The Granada Theater. 

They had outside seating available and a NYE prefix menu that looked promising. 

They had lobster tail or prime rib so we were going to get both and share... We were seated and found out that they ran out of lobster tail... No big deal, we just both ordered the prime rib prefix dinner. We told them we had to leave by 8 and let them know that we only had 45 minutes to dine.

They brought our wines first, and they poured me the wrong one. We informed him and about 15 minutes later he brought out the right one. They weren't even busy inside. It was a laid back older crowd that looked like they wanted to be there all night, at least until 9pm then probably go home and sleep.

Then when they brought the correct drink there still was no soup or salad that we had ordered. We waited patiently. There was another couple that was frustrated and had to go inside to get WAITED on so we had to do the same thing. Once we explained the situation AGAIN they promptly brought out the Prime Rib first. Which was Well Done and when we ordered it they asked how we wanted it. We, of course, said medium rare. 

When I asked the wine server why these were well done and told him that we told the waiter we ordered them medium rare he told me,  ""Oh, He's Sick.""

Then came the salad and the soup. The lady that dropped it off even told us, ""See, if you come inside and get us then we get you what you need.""

The point is we shouldn't have to come inside and get you? How hard would it have been to bring a small dinner salad then 5-10 minutes later the soup. It was all backwards and all at once. They even brought me the wrong soup.

Then we had dessert and downed the Champagne and we were on our way. 

The food was forgettable and the service was not... In the worst kind of way.

This was a fantastic NYE that we had thought out the day, and unfortunately instead of me remembering our dinner as awesome. It will forever be remembered as less then stellar.

Walking down State St. on New years Eve with out of town guests and this was one of the few restaurants open. Decided to take a chance on their special: $36 for wine, soup, salad, lobster or prime rib, triffle, and champagne. 

Pro:  Lobster was plentiful and good, soup was tasty
Con: - House wine not so great. Couldn't tell the merlot from the cab and neither was 
           good.
         - Soup portion too small 
         - Prime rib was overdone/tough. Both owner and waiter explained that ""it's 
           difficult to get varying degrees of doneness within a roast""
         - triffle dessert was nothing more than fruit cocktail and jello with a smattering of

The Mimosa was slow to arrive and even though I was nursing it, it was gone long before the Eggs Benedict arrived.

My husband and I had lunch here a few days ago. The food was fine. Nothing to write home about nor complain about.  My issue is with the illegal charge that was added to my tip amount.  

I am one that monitors my account daily with my receipts.  I know this may seem trivial but the bottom line is it was an illegal act. I had to ask for my my copy of the receipt once I signed it.  

In checking my account this morning I noticed that a $3.00 amount was added to my tip amount through my online banking final amount.  I phoned my bank, we made a conference call to the restaurant and spoke with the owner Trini.  

I asked to stay on the line while she located her copy of the transaction.  She confirmed that ""I"" left a $9.00 tip. I stated that I have my original copy that ""I "" signed which was for a  ""$6.00 tip"" 

At the top of our conversation I asked if I could fax a copy of my receipt to her and she stated they did not have a fax, I asked if I could email it.  She said yes.  After she came back to the phone, she stated that she did not have an email address and wanted to mail me the money in a check. 

I stated that this was a credit card issue and I wanted her to issue a refund through her terminal.  She stated she was unable to do that. I said that I was also a merchant and know that it is possible and can be done instantly.  She then said I am not sure if I can do this today.  The time was 2:40pm.  All banking institutions are still open at this time! 

I told her at that point that I did not feel comfortable and i would exercise my right to file a dispute for the charges with my bank.  My banking institution witnessed the call and made notes and will file a formal complaint. 

Keep in mind in Santa Barbara, the majority of people do not look at price tags let alone follow up with the accurate charges.

It can be overwhelming to choose the ""right"" one for your eating/drinking/socializing needs. La Arcada is one of the many options to choose from. How does it stack up?

La Arcada is a cute bistro located on a corner real estate offering indoor and outdoor seating in an Irish meets Spanish- ambiance (which makes sense as the owner is Irish while his wife is Mexican). During the early afternoon, it is calm and inviting but apparently can get rowdy on weekends when there is live Irish music reverberating the air. Think: Irish bar meets cafe with rustic wood trim but stuccoed walls. 

Although La Arcada didn't have too many customers at the time of our patronage (between 2 and 3pm); I didn't feel quite that welcome. It isn't that the server and staff were rude per se; they just weren't that inviting. Not to mention: slow. Very, very slow. Despite this, we browsed the menu having not yet eaten lunch seeking some light fare. My boyfriend and I decided to share plates and went with the House Salad (Grilled chicken, fire-roasted red peppers, red onion, blue cheese, toasted pine nuts,red delicious apples and mixed greens tossed with balsamic vinaigrette-- $16.00) and the Irish Soda Bread (with Kerry Gold butter and Dubliner Cheese -- $6.00). Due to it being Happy Hour, we also shared a Bellini ($5.00). 

The key to La Arcada is presentation. The salad and bread arrived at the same time and had an elegant but approachable feel. The salad was absolutely delicious with just the right amount of vinaigrette, tender chicken, and veggies. Although it was enough for my boyfriend and I to share; I still think it was much overpriced though for the quantity. Not necessarily satisfying if you are very hungry. The Irish Soda bread was a good deal with plenty of bread and large slices of cheese. I found the bread to be a little dry (and I love Irish Soda bread so I've had it plenty of times). It wasn't awful but I wasn't blown away. The Bellini was a highlight though. It was tasty and strong which is great being that it was a happy hour price and sometimes restaurants water down drinks during those times. 

A minor note but still worth mentioning is that the bathroom is a single-stall meaning that you have to wait quite a long time if someone is inside. Plus, it is an awkward back of the house area next to run down soda machines. Not good if you really have to use the bathroom!

There honestly isn't much more to be said about La Arcada. The experience wasn't bad but also not memorable on the positive side; making it simply an okay medium-choice on State Street but not life-changing. If nothing else though, the outdoor seating is quaint with great views of State Street. I would say this is a hit or miss option in lovely Santa Barbara.",2014-11-03 20:04:25

We were here for lunch, and loved the fact that we could get outdoor seating right in the prime realty area of state street in SB, so that was a great start. Then they forgot my mom's iced tea about 4 times, and we just felt awkward having to reorder it each time. Their lunch menu isn't the cheapest in the world, but for a bistro on state street what do you expect? I got their crab melt sandwich which was overly greasy to me. I could feel the oil and cheese on my fingers way more than I wanted to, and this is coming from someone who absolutely loves cheese. It was just an okay sandwich. 

Then my mom got here french dip sandwich and when she opened it up, noticed that all of the meat had so much fat on it, she had to burn a ton of extra calories cutting away at all of the fat in her sandwich! Who wants to eat pure fat? No one pretty much. And for a sandwich of that price, that work should already be done for the consumer. Better yet, buy better quality meat without that extra fat in it! My uncle thought his salad was so so and their homemade soup was also nothing to scream home about either. Really we all just felt blah, and left wishing we had eaten somewhere else.",2012-06-22 18:34:16

Aaaaand now, they're all over California but still a bit of a drive. Now that they're in California though, I never made the time out of my way to grab a box like before. Yes, cool they're ""0 grams of trans fat"" but they're another good brand for donuts.

Service: Fast & easy. When you're stuck at deciding which donut to grab, they'll be happy to tell you their favorites or seasonal flavor. I wasn't too hungry nor craving for a box so I went for the munchkins. The donut holes that will justify your sweet tastebuds. I got all flavors, but butternut was a definite good one right next to the glazed blueberry. 

Verdict: Hmm... hard to decide now that donuts nowadays have a crazier hype with several flavors & extraordinary combinations. As a donut fanatic, this is one of those simply grab & go, fast & easy donut shops with a higher quality taste & brand. A cleaner, new looking donut shop instead of a ""corner, by the gas station, or old fashioned"" shop. I would grab a box mainly for those who do not have dunkin donuts around them. At least their donuts are well labeled!

He seemed like a nice guy. Later on, I found out that he called his partner yelling at him telling him that they ""Don't give freebies."" It's ok if there's no freebies, we were planning on paying if we had to. Just don't pretend and tell us that you'll do something for us and walk away and leave us hanging. But the review is not about the manager. Hopefully the business will run smoother once they are more experienced.

The line was about 20 minutes long. The environment was very cute. I like the seating areas (indoor and outdoor). Too bad it rained that day because the furniture outside were all wet. My husband likes old fashions. They didn't have any so he had to order some plains instead. I like apple fritters and I didn't see any there. We ordered 1 coffee and my husband asked for 1 cream. They put 2 creams in there. I had the caramel ice coffee. I like McDonald's Frappe or the Starbucks' Fraps or Ten Ren's caramel milk tea with boba. We had the breakfast sandwich. It was ok. Nothing special. We also bought a dozen donuts. I had to say their Boston Cream was pretty good. I brought it home for my mom and she liked it. The other donuts were nothing to rave about. We ended up tossing the donuts after a couple of days. I guess I didn't need to go to Santa Barbara for Dunkin Donuts other to see my friend because they have one in Whittier, close to home.

The jelly donut was significantly smaller than usual. It was also not as good. The cake was dry and had no soft, pillowy texture. A better jelly donut can be found at other spots in town: Winchell's and Spudnuts.

My friend and I drove and eventually parked in the shopping plaza's parking structure that has the first 60-90 minutes for free. I actually didn't even know there was a shopping plaza parking structure as downtown SB always seems to be so busy that you kind of just want to avoid driving down there to avoid being stuck in traffic and/or trying to find street parking (so definitely a plus there!).

We found Le Macaron French Pastries located down one of the shopping plaza pathways near a bunch of restaurants and shops that also sold ice cream and what not. The outside of the shop looks very clean and it still looks fairly new so we were excited to try it.

Once you walk in, the glass displays show all the different types of chocolates and colorful macarons available to choose from. At a price of about $2 per macaron (definitely on the higher side considering even Lette's is $1.85/macaron), we hoped that they lived up to their hype as we purchased a couple to taste: 2 salted caramel and an espresso. As we turned to the other side, we notice that they also sold gelato in another freezer display case. We had a couple sample licks and decided we've had better so declined to order any.

After paying for our macarons, we walked outside to taste them and were definitely not highly impressed with the flavors. The expresso one was pretty decent, but the salted caramel ones tasted more heavily of chocolate fillings than the salted caramel sweet and salty mix I was expected and paid for.

Similarly, the glazed donut was a bit dense, with sticky icing, instead of a fluffy donut with flaky icing.  The coffee, which I've heard is good, tasted weak and watered down to me.  They also add the cream for you, so you can't control the exact amount: I asked for one cream, but it was still too creamy.

I went into the one in Santa Barbara, which just opened the other day, and waited for what had to have been at least 20 minutes and even was solicited to put in my donut order ahead of time.

Efficient, right?

WRONG.

They completely missed my donut order.  Didn't get on the ticket, or anything.  Plus, after I ordered two breakfast sandwiches that have croissant as the bread part, they sent me to a waiting area to wait for my order.  This is fine; but after a few minutes more of waiting they belatedly tell me that they have run out of croissants.

This turned me off so much, and I'll tell you why: ANY business that is just starting out in an area (to say nothing of any business that is just opening) makes sure they have enough stock on hand to meet all orders.  You build stuff like this in, purposely, to your opening costs.

Running out of something like croissant (because let's face it - nobody likes those, right? (:-0!!) is really short sighted, bad business, bad management.

The manager apologized and acknowledged the error, but you know?

This is management 101 when you're opening a store: YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF PRODUCT.

So I would say, give these guys a look - they've got good stuff -  but maybe wait a few weeks until the hub bub dies down - or, maybe, call ahead to make sure they haven't run out of anything.

They also decided to not build a drive up window into the building, which, I mean, is a natural for traffic flow and convenience..

The parking lot is narrow and crowded.  You really have to keep a heads up to make sure you're not backing into a pedestrian, because there isn't a lot of extra room.",2016-06-08 17:28:05

I asked for four coffee's, one black, three with cream only. That was the end of nice. OMG,  They called my number and gave me two coffee's and they went back to work so to say.

This was a safety and liability issue in my opinion and they did not seem to care. Bottom line: about 8 people behind the counter, looked like nobody in charge, no process or rhythm being followed, not friendly, all very young high school aged and immature. There was no supervision period. Everybody looked like they had their head in sand, nobody looking up at customers. Just taking orders and money and mine was not the only order they flubbed.

2. Colombian Coffee: Strong Colombian Coffee flavor - tastes like a mini espresso, lol!
3. Lemon Cream: Sweet and tangy, it was lovely!

5. Lavender Chocolate: Aromatic, but I tasted more chocolate than lavender in this one.
6. Praline: Shell shattered after first bite - taste was boring to me. 

Service: The lady helping me was nice and friendly. She answered all my questions when inquiring about the macaron flavors, and package them up nicely.

The fact they have no diners due to COVID but can't seem to have a clean dining room area is beyond me.  Outside had trash everywhere like bums slept outside and the trash was overflowing.  The bright side is they wore masks and gloves.  The cashier couldn't answer any question regarding the menu, and made my drink wrong.  Granted it was 11am but they had very little products available so resorted to a breakfast sandwich instead of the doughnuts I wanted. It was a pretty good sandwich.  I won't come here again.",2020-05-10 18:54:50

Tried 2 different donuts and they were so dry and unappetizing that I would've gone for a more moist prepackaged donut at a gas station. Donuts are one of my favorite things and I usually can't contain my excitement but I was so disappointed that I had to redeem myself at spudnuts and sulk about all the delicious hipster donut spots in LA. They could've even brought a Krispy Kreme and I would've been happy.

 Coffee is nothing spectacular either unless you're the Starbucks/McDonald's type who drowns the precious drink in sweet syrups and creamers. Had a sip of a cold brew and asked myself ""why"".",2016-07-23 20:31:15
