I loved the hint of the lemon because it wasn't too overwhelming and the maple syrup was really good too! I also ordered the hot chocolate and it was delicious. I am very picky about my hot chocolate and it was just right! My only confusion was where to put my dishes once I was done but I asked an employee and he was very kind and told me to leave them on the table. Go try it everyone!,2013-05-07 16:31:16

Ioi_RMBvhEAYZg0vjeRwrw,5mo4zCTWU_MQf1tdGAoV4g,O6RCCmz8-x4NhWJpI8KQug,4,0,0,0,"I admire Breakfast for opening their space to all-ages shows, regularly featuring artists' photos, paintings, even sculptures, and hosting casual food pop ups. 

I know many reviewers have said the left side of the shop is gimmicky and ""too hip"" (branded merch, surf/skate mags, and comfy chairs), but the last time I was here kids were loving the connect four out on the table-- what's to hate about that? 

That said, their espresso can be hit or miss, and sometimes my Gibraltar milk is a little too hot and a little too fluffy, but they use good beans and their drip brew is great. Yes, their staff can be intimidatingly terse, but regulated cheeriness (that's the norm at shops that rhyme with CandleJar) doesn't have a place here. I like that. 

Where else in Santa Barbara can you sit on a sofa and drink a cuppa? Find an outlet next to your table? Simple problems; Breakfast is a simple answer.",2018-09-03 18:35:48

First of all, they put amazing samples of breads with olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar.  I could craze along the counter all day, and be a very happy man.  I have to say that their olive bread is to die for.  After loading up on the carbs, you are ready for something refreshing.  The salads are beyond exceptional.  The ingredients are dripping with freshness, and feels like farm to table while you wait.  If you are looking for a sandwich, the Cubano is just the ticket.  The first time I went in, I asked the cashier what she recommended because I was having a hard time deciding.  She told me that her favorite, without a doubt, was the Cubano.  So, I gave it a shot.  Now, I need my fix at least once a week.  I think there is an addictive agent in that sandwich.  It's probably in the bread - ya know, the bread that they have calling and enticing you from the top of the display case like a seductress.  Oh, did I fail to mention that once they get you in their grip, you're soon turned onto the pastries and goodies in the display case???  They have so many to choose from, and each one looks delectable.  They even have vegan and gluten free, which I was skeptical about, but very happily surprised.  I would be totally neglectful if I didn't mention the AWESOME staff.  They are genuine, fun, and really ensure that you have a positive experience.  No matter what mood you walk into Our Daily Bread in, you leave in a great mood.  So, if you need/want a new addiction in your life and to be treated like the most important person around, Our Daily Bread is a stop for you.",2014-04-03 21:59:46

Breakfast Culture Club serves my favorite espresso in Santa Barbara. In fact, it's some of the best espresso I've ever had (better than even the best I've found in LA/SF). It has a fruited sweetness to it, a hint of red fruit, perfect mouthfeel, and insane sweetness. Their beans are from Coava, which I'd never had until coming here, and the espresso blend is just brilliant. I think they used to use coffee from Handlebar, which also makes good espresso, but I'm very glad they switched because Coava makes a much more interesting espresso (Handlebar is good, but very typical--roasty toasty notes, caramelly, but definitely not fruity).

I like to get a Gibraltar, a Cappuccino, or just straight espresso. The Gibraltar and Cappuccino both bring out the strawberry notes of the espresso, and end up very sweet because the espresso is just great here. The texture they achieve on their milk is fantastic as well--exactly what I want in a Cappuccino. That said, if I want something with more punch I just go straight for the espresso.

Their toasts are also very good. I think they've changed how they do toasts since previous reviewers posted--they prepare the toast for you, so it actually is instagram ready if you're into that :)

As for ambiance, this place is perfect. The opened garage door makes the whole place feel very open and spacious. Strong hipster and surfer vibes around, you'll often see people barefoot. Also usually a couple people working on their laptops. There's about 4 or 5 power outlets available. Usually I've been able to get a spot with an outlet if I need it, but in the morning it can be so busy that it's hard to find a free table with an outlet.

Highly recommend stopping in here if you like fruitier espresso drinks.",2018-08-16 07:03:58

I had just been in San Francisco and had crazy good toast at The Mill. There's really no one doing toast in So Cal except for here. Huge thick pieces of toast served with fresh ground peanut butter and homemade strawberry preserves. Seriously - this whopping piece of toast was enough for 2 people. 

I know they supply a number of local restaurants with their bread but it's great to stop in here and pick up a loaf for yourself at home. In the mornings, they often have a selection of their fresh loaves cut up for you to sample. Fantastic!!",2015-06-12 03:18:59

I was up in Santa Barbara the other day and we noticed this Cafe as we drove around.

The next day when we wanted to go out for breakfast I went to YELP to read the reviews.

Its rating was good enough for us to go try it and we are so happy we did.
Though I will say this place is better then its  current rating of 3.5 stars.

We almost turned around  and left when we first got there because the menu posted on the front door said that breakfast was only served until 11 AM and it was 11:10 when we got there.   Fortunately I walked inside and asked the gentlemen behind the counter if we could still get breakfast.  He informed me that  BREAKFAST IS SERVED ALL DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Those are my five favorite words in the world at a Restaurant as breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.

I ordered a 3 egg omelette with the breakfast potatoes and sourdough toast. 
My friend had the Breakfast Burrito.  They were both FABULOUS!  The omelette was light and fluffy.  They do not chince on the ingrediants I had plenty of tomatos in my omelette.  The breakfast potatoes were delish.  

We ordered a cup of  coffee and that was also outstanding.  They give you a cup and its self serve.  I love that.  They have plenty of options for things you can add to your coffee such as Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Chocolate powder.  You can also order Espressos and other coffees that they prepare for you.

Even though we were stuffed we decided to try something for dessert.  We went with the Cinnamon Roll with Pecans  (I think they call it a Schneiken?).  It was so good.

We left there full and content.

It was a no brainer where we were going to breakfast today- right back to Our Daily Bread.

The ciabatta bread is to die for, I had that with my omelette today. Their Rye bread is also top notch.

The employees are warm and friendly.  Really a nice crew.

The prices are a bit high, but its Santa Barbara so its to be expected. Breakfast for two was just under $30.00 the first day and $28 the second day.  That was without the extra treats we bought after breakfast.  I adore carrot cake, but would not recommend the one they sell here.  The texture of the cake was odd- it was actually ""squishy"" and wet when you bit into it. 

I understand they are very busy on the weekends but since we will be up there one more day, we might just brave the crowds so we can have one more fix of this terrific place.",2014-05-10 01:21:02

I had the three egg omelette with mushroom, spinach, and tomatoes. With some greens with a homemade vinaigrette dressing. Topped with a healthy portion of avocados. I bite into it and the freshness was evident in the firm veggies. Their multi grain toast was homemade and complimented the omelette well. I just needed to add a ""punch"" of pepper :) 

My breakfast partner ordered the Veggie breakfast burrito with egg whites. It came with cheese and fresh salsa. Well made put together burrito. Again I use this word, but I mean it people. It tasted fresh!! Veggies were good. Most importantly it was light.

Definitely a huge addition and asset to the De La Vina food scene. It's an amazing bakery with two epic bonuses: 1) they serve breakfast and lunch with quick, simple, but delicious items at reasonable prices & 2) (my favorite part) they have a la marzocco espresso machine and they know how to use it!!! Simply put: their lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, or any other steam pulled hot drinks are PERFECT. Something to be said for the old school way of hand steaming your milk and if you don't believe me taste test one of their lattes against a machine steamed one from Starbucks or coffee bean. 
Enough on coffee though, it's a bakery first and foremost and the selection is pretty robust. Baguettes, loaves, rolls, pastries, croissants, cookies.... It's all delicious and the staff are an epic part to ODB's success. They've certainly made a regular out of me!",2013-10-05 18:19:55

First, when I walked up and saw the open air cafe I was blown away by how cool this placed look and was stoked to see there was a line b/c that generally means that you are in store for a treat when locals take the time to wait for fare.  

Then after waiting in line for a while it occurred to me that maybe the line was due to the comically slow service.  I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.

Finally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.  The coffee was a perfect complement to the wonderfully sour toast.

Rolled up two car garage with just open air seating. Very clean, white, and minimalist. There are more than enough tables and chairs for studying, working, or chatting. To the left is where they display all their merch, couch with board games. 

I know the name screams BREAKFAST, but this is not really a breakfast joint. It's more of a coffee / tea / pastry place. They have a small menu for drinks and a small pastry case. I'm not a coffee person, but I tried their Matcha latte with almond milk and that was flavorful! Their chocolate chip cookie is delish. Such a hip and clean space.

Farmer's Market Salad was light and near perfection.

I can't tell you how much this compassion in the midst of a majorly traumatic day (that turned into 5 weeks of displacement) meant to us. We got the last couple of breakfast sandwiches, avocado toast,  latte and matcha latte. Everything was tasty! Nicely curated sweet and savory menu. Plus good vibes in a modern space.

Ah...the smell of fresh baked bread, there's nothing like it!

I had the hot Chicken Pesto Sandwich on a roll. This was a tasty sandwich with the pesto not being too overpowering of the other ingredients. The chicken was moist and tender and the roll was fresh with just enough crunch.

My dining companions had the Gobbler and a half salad with chicken. Since there was no bread brought with the salad I simply went up and got a couple of the free slices that they offer. Problem solved for her!

The sandwiches come with a small salad with nice greens and tomatoes.

I love the donuts here and I'm pretty sure it's the only place in town where you can get v donuts. They also have delicious vegan bagels and vegan cream cheese - yaasss! I must confess, I've tried every type of pastry they have here. If I had to rank them donuts are first, then bagels, followed by the banana nut muffin, and everything else is equally ok after that.

They serve Handlebar coffee and have many milk options, including my favorite almond milk. Also, on Sundays they have breakfast burritos! They have a vegan and non-vegan option. I opted for the meatless option which was delicious! It consisted of potatoes, tofu, onions, bell peppers, quinoa, and vegan cheese. 

To those complaining about the name, I actually really like it plus read the rest of it ""Culture Club."" It definitely has a lovely culture and vibe. I appreciate the art and cozy feel. The unconventional name is a good representation of the type of business this is - unconventional!

It is called BREAKFAST Culture Club but it's really just a coffee shop with some pastries and eventually breakfast sandwiches (they didn't have them available yet during my visit but were said to be coming in a few weeks). With all this said, DON'T EXPECT BRUNCH! I ended up grabbing a breakfast burrito at Romanti-Ezer Mexican Food Truck which shares the parking lot. 

The space is part of a modern strip mall shared with Kanaloa Seafood and an office space.  I liked that they offered soy, almond and oat milk which is nice addition, but their coffee was simply mediocre for a Seattle coffee snob like myself. Based on my first-hand visit, they focus mostly on being a ""culture club"" by combining a communal space, coffee drinks and artist culture. As their website states: ""Founded on the principle of connecting artists around the world, Breakfast is by and for a group of friends who like to make things and go places."" Their walls are covered by fun local art; there's even a map of the art, its artist bio and price. You can also check out their featured artists on their website: http://www.breakfastcultureclub.com/culture/.

I like their pastry selection but feel like they could offer more in terms of breakfast food, since it's in their name!

The morning of December 5th, we were evacuating from The Thomas Fire. Hungry, and in need of coffee and a place to figure out where we could find lodging with two cats and 5 year old son, I told my husband to drive to Breakfast Culture Club. (I had noticed it the last time I had an appointment in SB.) 

The manager overheard us talking to some other evacuees in line about our plight and said he'd comp our food and drinks before we ordered. 

I can't tell you how much this compassion in the midst of a majorly traumatic day (that turned into 5 weeks of displacement) meant to us. We got the last couple of breakfast sandwiches, avocado toast, latte, matcha latte and cowboy cookie. Everything was really tasty! Bonus: they have Coava coffee from Portland. Plus good vibes in a modern space. Nicely curated pastry and savory menu. Please support this awesome business.",2018-01-28 05:51:19

My donut was 4.50 and there were only 3 on display and the stingy in me didn't even care. They were hyped up donuts if anything. And if all the pastries are vegan, they might be vegan too. There was a donut that resembled a Somoa Girl Scout cookie, one with an orange glaze and literally a snicker doodle in the hole, and an orange marmalade donut, so there's an idea of what you're paying for. 

I picked the orange marmalade and it was reeeeally dense. I had to go home and eat that fool with a fork and a steak knife. Regardless, the denseness and size became my lunch and it was delicious. So yeah that was a 4.50 orange marmalade donut sandwich reminiscent of Donut Friend in LA. Cold brew was delicious and tasted like good cold brew. 

I love the look of this place and have been eyeing to go here for a while. Stepping in was refreshing and I really like the interior. Oh yeah, the barista was hilarious.

If you work in the area, like I do, you'll be thrilled to have a locally owned and operated business in your neck of the woods instead of hitting one of the commercial coffee mega giants. 

Breakfast Culture Club serves up delicious brew from Handlebar Roasting Company and yummy pastries from Flag Stone Pastries, including a vast selection of vegan treats. 

The layout is expansive with seating inside at multiple tables, outside on their patio overlooking Chapala St and a living room like area with a sofa and coffee table. 

The staff are warm and friendly. If you frequent French Press or Handlebar, you'll probably even recognize a few of their smiling faces. 

I love the art on the wall from Xst! Super cool portraits taken mostly with an iPhone. I could definitely see myself hanging art like this on my wall at home. 

They have plenty of merchandise for sale if that tickles your fancy, too! This looks like a great place to work remotely, study, read, chat with friends and/or just chill and people watch. 

There is a small parking lot in front of the shop or plenty of 75 minute street parking on the roads nearby. I'm so glad this is so close and look forward to getting my coffee fix regularly! On that note, I tend to be more of tea or matcha drinker these days and I did not pay attention to see if they carry either of those. If not, bring matcha please!",2016-05-23 20:36:03

2 months before the wedding we met her at her studio to have a cake tasting. For $25, we could taste 6-7 slices of all different sorts of cake flavors, icings and fillings. We ended up choosing a 2 layer cake with the first layer being a chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and fresh raspberries, and the second layer a white cake with a cream and lemon filling. For the icing we picked a white fondant that was decorated in a traditional pattern. We choose to decorate the cake with fresh flowers that matched my wife's bouquet, which Christine was able to do herself on the day of our wedding at no extra cost!

As for the day of, Christine was able to deliver our cake to Bouchon before dinner, as well as display/decorate the cake herself. When we arrived to the restaurant from the wedding ceremony, it was beautifully presented off to the side of the room!

As for the cake itself, it was exceptionally delicious and fresh, and we had real trouble trying to pick which flavor of cake we enjoyed more! Having been on a wedding diet for a while, it was a real treat to indulge in both an aesthetically beautiful and exquisitely tasteful cake!

She was very professional and warm throughout the process, from setting up the tasting appointment to mailing us photos of our cake after the wedding!

We went to a few tastings and Christine Dahl's cakes blew the others away. We went with a white buttercream applied in a horizontal ribbon pattern and two flavors on the inside. (Different flavors for the different tiers.) One flavor was a half chocolate half white cake with chocolate ganache and raspberry filling (my husband's pick) and my pick was a vanilla cake with passion fruit and coconut - I think this is the best cake I've ever eaten in my life. No joke.

Christine Dahl seems to prefer phone contact over e-mail- I have phone shyness so I was a little nervous at first but it ended up being fine and more direct and she actually picked up whenever I called.

I told Christine I wanted to have some succulents decorating the cake and she said she was familiar with the florist I was using (grassroots) so I told the florist as well and they took care of it - I never had to deal with it. All I know is, when I showed up at my wedding, a beautiful cake was there and was decorated with succulents that matched my wedding flowers.

Her prices are very reasonable considering the excellent quality and it was easy to work with her within our specified budget and approximate number of guests. She's a real pro. Besides being an excellent baker, it's clear she has a lot of experience and runs her business professionally. I would recommend you go straight to her for your wedding cake!",2014-07-03 18:04:43

Ultimately, it was the promise of salted caramel cupcakes (and her great reviews) that drew me in! I contacted Carole, only a few weeks before the wedding date, and she was so helpful and responsive. She delivered 4 cupcake samples to our house so we could choose the flavors, and once we figured out what we wanted, the rest was as simple as we could ever have asked for! 

The cupcakes -- plus a lovely cutting cake, with our names on it -- were delivered to our reception venue while we were at the ceremony, and they were as delicious as they were gorgeous! 

Carole was wonderful to work with, and her cupcakes are fabulous! The Nutella chocolate cupcakes are to die for.

FzeZ9tTPplvCkbxv7ILriQ,d36Jga_C5dbTQjVn1mQX0A,QS0a4snAEc-zdLeLIgTaHg,5,0,0,0,"OMG, I cannot say enough good things about Carole and her most excellent baking enterprise.

To start with, I do not live in Santa Barbara, but in the San Francisco bay area, yet I needed to locate a local-to-Santa-Barbara baker to bake a cake for my mother's 80th (!) birthday party.  And not just any cake - this was an effort to re-create, or at least approximate, a cake she used to buy at a bakery in Dallas, TX, back in the 60's.  (no pressure there, eh?)

Thank you, yelp*, for helping me to find Delicious Expressions and Carole.  I called her and discussed what I wanted - just one week in advance of the party.  Then I checked with my mother about party plans.  Tweaking was necessary - the date of the party, and certain details about the cake needed to be changed.

I finally placed my order for the cake just 4 days before the party:
a two-layer lemon cake with lemon curd filling, topped with lemon curd, with lemon buttercream frosting on the sides, and with unsweetened shredded coconut on top (tastes good, and helps pretty-up the lemon curd).

Carole promised that the cake would serve 8-12 people.  Her charge for the cake was very reasonable, AND that included the delivery!

Here's the best part:  a couple of days after I ordered the cake, I suddenly remembered that although the yelp reviews I had read had all been very positive, few of them had mentioned the cake itself - the flavor, texture, taste, etc.  - and I am one particular gal when it comes to cake.  I re-read the reviews and found one that mentioned how delicious the cake was - although it did not go into the sort of detail I was looking for.  So I admit I was a little worried...

I am happy to provide a report now:  This cake was OUTSTANDINGLY delicious!!  The cake was light - yet not so light as to resemble something out of a cake-mix box.  It was moist, yet not oily.  For my taste, a perfect cake - soft and cakey and just-moist-enough.  The lemon buttercream frosting that decorated the side of the cake was really delicious - everything one hopes a good buttercream will be - smooth and moist and rich and flavorful, like a dense, lemony whipped cream.  (And I am not really a huge frosting fan, so it has to be just right for me to want to eat it all.)

When I placed the order with Carole, she was a little surprised (and, I think, a bit concerned) about all that lemon.  I explained to her that we are people who love lemon, and she agreed to make it as I requested.  When she delivered the cake, she told me that since I said we liked lemon so much, she had even added some lemon to it!  Well, it was PERFECT!!!!  And I was, and am, THRILLED with every aspect of the finished product.

One final note:  We had 10 people for dinner, and the layer cake was ample for our purposes.  When dinner was over, we had consumed about 2/3 of the cake; later that evening, there was less, because I had to have seconds.  Carole told me it would serve 8-12; well, those 8 portions would have been HUGE.

Oh, and yes - my mom loved it!!  Thank you, Carole, for putting the perfect finishing touch on my mother's 80th birthday party!!!

In sum - DELICIOUS Expressions is a wonderfully apt name for this baking enterprise.  You can trust everything everyone else has posted here on yelp about this local business, and you can now know that in addition to the quick service, and all the things other yelpers have posted, that Carole bakes a delicious cake!",2011-12-21 00:36:27

First and foremost, all I have to say is... Salted. Caramel. Vanilla. Cake.  Again... Salted caramel vanilla cake.  It was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted in my life.  But... rewind a bit.  At first, I asked to have the cake delivered (which, in and of itself, is amazing.  It's SO hard to find a bakery, let alone a GREAT bakery, that will deliver) to the place I chose to have dinner at that night... but then I found out that the dinner spot didn't open until 5PM... which was later than when Delicious Expressions stopped delivering.  They had no problem switching the delivery spot at the last minute to a winery where a group of friends and I were having a wine tasting earlier in the afternoon.  

I'm not sure what else to say, except that the cake was magnificent, their service was impeccable, and their cakes... even with as astounding as they are... are totally reasonably priced.  The cake was a hit with everyone that tried it, and I can't recommend this place enough.

After trying wedding cakes at five Santa Barbara/Montecito bakeries, I almost gave up. Her location is difficult to find, but once you do, you will not regret it!

Ms. Dahl was very patient as we looked through hundreds of pictures of wedding cake designs and sampled four of her cakes. She has a book filled to the brim with photographs of her gorgeous creations. Ms. Dahl was very concerned that I got the exact design and colors I wanted to match my wedding.

I ended up choosing a 3 tier cake with 2 tiers made of her absolutely delicious vanilla cake with passionfruit and coconut filling. The one tier made of her decadent chocolate cake was also scrumptious. However, I highly recommend the passionfruit/coconut - my wedding guests are still raving about it!

The best part about my wedding cake from Christine Dahl Pastries was the taste. I think that a Duncan Hines cake that came from a box tastes better than most wedding cakes. Ms. Dahl's creation was easily the best cake I have ever had. It didn't taste bland and my guests actually ate it!

Even the fondant was more than edible, it was actually tasty, which is usually not the case.  The price was not bad ... I think $250 for a three tier cake for 50 people.  The top and bottom layers were chocolate with chocolate filling and a chocolate hazelnut ganache.  The middle layer was a white cake with lemon filling and a fresh berry layer.  She was great when we did the tasting, and worked with us to make a beautiful cake.  My only minor qualm with the wedding cake was that we had asked her if the cake layers could be slightly thicker and the filling slightly thinner, as I thought it was a bit much, she said sure, but it didn't really happen.  We just went back to her for our anniversary and she made us a small cake, which again was delicious (the same chocolate hazelnut filling).  On the anniversary cake, when we picked it up, it wasn't decorated the same, and she said that was because she didn't have a picture of our cake (bummed she didn't call or email us - we have plenty of pics of it).  Also, when we got our wedding cake, she told us the price for the anniversary cake was $25, but when the time came, she said it would be $40.

Also, the main reason I booked with Christine was that she has the skill set to execute a technique with gold painting. Basically its an edible gold that is painted onto fondant. Anyway, most bakeries in Santa Barbara either could not do it or charged ridiculous prices for cakes with these style on them. 

Christine is an excellent baker. This became extremely apparent at our cake tasting where we sampled between 8 and 10 samples of different cake flavors and different fillings.

I opted for the vanilla yogurt and granola with fresh fruit, which may not sound like a boring choice, but was delicious and very filling.

This place is PACKED on Sunday brunch. It's a great location, unlike the upper State St. or Montecito ones. 
Since it's downtown and beat they parking structure, you can enjoy a nice stroll before/after Jeannine's.

Brunch menu offers a good variety from pancakes to egg Benedict to French toast to omelettes. 
I like how there's variety and creativity in the menu options.

For ex: Lobster omelette, Kahlua French toast, crabs egg Benedict, etc.

The food came out super fast!!! And you must ORDER FIRST. When you walk in, get a take number, then order, and you tell the cashier your table number so that the waiter will bring out your food at your table...

I had their egg white scramble with asparagus, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a side of biscuit. 
My only complaint is the biscuit. I know it's just a biscuit and it comes with pretty much most of the entrees... But the biscuit could be made a little better. I didn't like it at all. It was sort of bland, hard, and no fluff to it. :(

My friends shared a breakfast burrito and that was pretty large. Def fun to share bc it's a lot.

I also tasted their smoothies...mango, pineapple, banana.  It's okay I think they could do a better job with the balance of each fruit. It was a little too sour.

For all you Peet's Coffee lovers. Jeannine's serves their cafe, freddos, cappuccinos, etc.

Mouthfuls of liquer-coated challah drowning in saccharine, bombarded with chunks of banana. If the French really made toast like this, their pain perdu would be heart attack central (no mistranslation pun intended). 

The greek frittata was devoured. Accompanying fruit (pineapple, strawberries, blueberries) was fresh. My friend's lobster benedict was bleeding hollandaise (this dish is bookmarked).

She ordered an omelet with goat cheese while I had French Toast with caramelized bananas.  Talk about dessert for breakfast.  We shared both, which is good since the French Toast plate would have been more calories than I like to eat in a weekend.  The omelet was also really good, surprisingly good for something that is really a simple dish.

No words to describe this place and since this is a family site, I will bust out in code (I rarely do this!), this place will have you literally saying, ""OMFG! MILF...MUH!"" (Man, I'd Love to Fill Myself Up Here!)

As they say, pictures can be deceiving but you can't taste the deliciousness of flavoring through a picture. If you could, I would have been a photographer! I want Apple to design a scratch 'n sniff/taste application! :)

Anyways, the host (I think her name was Sara) was real nice - super friendly and talked to us for a few minutes about their food. The food is a must-have as that one girl from The Real World would always say, ""point blank period!"" That is how I feel about this place. The best banana kahlua french toast I've ever had point blank period!!!

It brought me back to another place in Boston which had the best pancakes in the world. Well, this awesome place has the best, absolutely the best banana kahlua french toast in the world!!!

Their sweet potato fries were great too! They added black pepper to it which gave it some extra deliciousness. The sauce was regular though and I should suggest using a chipotle type of sauce since the two go together like my mouth-savory taste buds go together with Jeannine's.

Yes, it's that good that it'll make you tongue-tied and full of non-sense but at least you're full of awesomeness!!!

Overall, 50 thumbs up (since that's how many I saw getting their grub on)!!!!

We were greeted warmly and given water, our food came out in very reasonable times, and even sitting outside, everything was pretty clean.

My friends and I stuck to some safe choices and went for the Norwegian Benedict and the Dungeness Crab Omelet. If you can afford to splurge a bit, I'd recommend the Dungeness Crab Omelet. The omelet was pretty fluffy, and inside the omelet was a load of shredded crab meat. The meat tasted pretty fresh and was ""seafood-y"" in the best way possible (aka not fishy). The Norwegian Benedict was also pretty good, if not particularly exciting. At least all three orders of the Benedict came with perfectly done eggs.

I ordered the pancake breakfast with a vanilla latte and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito (which he found was great!). We found a table and sat for about 2 minutes when the gentleman that took our order told me that they couldn't make pancakes (that was the only reason we went there). I wanted to eat a sweet breakfast so I decided to sub with the french toast. Also a no-go. 

Disappointed, I just decided to go with the chicken pesto sandwich. I decided to not get grumpy over their lack of pancakes and french toast (you would think they would some bread and eggs for this?) but it was odd when one of the managers or supervisors yelled at me from across the room that my latte was on its way. 
Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was delicious and their lattes never disappoint. But the main reason I wanted to go was for their pancakes. I guess we shouldn't go on Thursdays anymore as they run out of the sweet stuff!

If you are dining with a large group, it's better to order and pay at the counter and not fuss about splitting the bill afterwards.  However, if that's not an issue, then sit and a waitress/waiter will take your order.

We ordered a variety of different dishes:

Breakfast Club
American Pancake Breakfast with French Toast
Eggs Benedict
Lobster Benedict
Veggie Benedict
Ricotta Poppy Seed Pancakes
Norwegian Benedict
Smoked Salmon Scramble

Everyone seemed to really like what they ordered.  I got the American Pancake Breakfast with French Toast.  The bacon was thick, full of flavor, and chewy, not crispy.  I enjoyed the challah bread french toast.  This may have been my first time trying this bread, but it was tasty with a drizzle of syrup.

I had a bite of the Ricotta Poppy Seed Pancakes--they were delicious.  There's a hint of lemon flavor in the pancakes, but not so much that it made your lips pucker after tasting something really sour.

For those who ordered lattes, the baristas added cute designs in the foam.  We found parking easily on Anacapa, make sure to pay attention to the signs.",2013-11-26 21:56:02

My friends and I parked at a parking garage on State Street which is free for the first 70 mins, and walked over to this cute, little restaurant. Street parking is also available. Order your food at the counter and then seat yourself inside or at their outdoor patio. 

Food: The restaurant serves benedicts, french toasts, oats grains and cereals, breakfast burritos/sandwich/quesadilla/plates, omelets,  salads and club/turkey berry/chicken pesto sandwiches. Since the dishes were a bit pricey and we wanted to leave our stomach for other restaurants, my friends and I shared a Norwegian Benedict ($16) and the Banana Kahlua French Toast ($13.50). The Norwegian Benedict had smoked salmon, two poached eggs, cucumbers\, tomato, onions, capers, cream cheese, dill and home-made hollandaise a side of fruits. The Banana Kahlua French Toast had Challah bread, dipped in spiced egg mix, kahlua-glazed bananas and powered sugar.  Both of the dishes were amazing!! Everything tasted so good and fresh. 

The staff was very friendly and I love the setup and decor of the place. However, they had TVs on the wall which kind of threw me off since I wasn't expecting TVs at a place like this.

The hours state that they are open at 6:30 but they only serve coffee and pastries between the hours of 6:30-7. In that time they set up the chairs that are piled upon the tables from the previous night and get the restaurant ready for the day. We arrived at 6:40 and settled ourselves by a window alongside other early bird patrons and patiently waited for 7'oclock to come around because we were looking forward to a nice hearty breakfast.

When 7  hit the waitress promptly came over to take our order. I had the special of the day which was smoked salmon hash but I preferred the kahlua banana french toast that my partner ordered. It was exquisite. It wasn't too boozy or too sweet. The bread was light and fluffy. If your in the mood for a sweet vs a savory breakfast, the French toast is their signature must order item. 

I also ordered a rasbperry scone to go, which the employee strangely heated up in what I think might have been a microwave, and then proceeded to give to me in clear plastic bag. This caught me off guard as I'm used to cute to-go containers. Maybe a  flimsy but cute brown cardboard box would have been more appropriate. The plastic bag trapped the steam and I was concerned that it would make the scone soggy but since I didn't eat it till hours later it was hard as a brick again and quite tasty.",2013-12-17 13:12:32

The lunch specials have been beefed up at all Jeannine's, however, and that's still worth a try. But the Montecito location is simply too small and because it remains a ""must try"" for tourists who read whoever SB publication plugs Jeannine's, the lines are long.

Coffee drinks and Iced Tea are perfect and the desserts are to die for.

You order at the counter and the host reserves your table with a number.

A few tips: smaller parties have an easier time being seated. They won't let you order unless you already have a table so be wary. I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups.

This is the best place for breakfast period. The food is made with quality ingredients and is consistent. The atmosphere on their out door patio is fantastic with a flutist playing soft music in the back ground on the weekend. But the absolute best thing about Jeannine's is the staff. The service is fantastic. They are more attentive and predictive then anywhere I've been. Little things like fixing a wobble table before you can ask. Bringing you extra salsa for your breakfast burrito because the previous visit you asked for more (how they remembered I don't know).

How about beautiful, creative, and colorful savory plates such as omelets or Benedicts?  Or is it healthier fare you are looking for?  Jeannine's has you covered on all fronts, along with spectacular coffee and a large side of solicitous service, served regardless of the length of the line spilling out onto the sidewalk.

Our group selected delicacies from each of these categories.  The heaping bowl of steel cut oats with fresh fruit made for an attractive and hearty start to the day.   Then came the freak of nature blueberry muffins, seemingly over 50% blueberries by weight and lusciously dense, that somehow managed to be both fat and gluten free: a feat of culinary engineering.  On the other end of the baked-goods-as-health-foods spectrum was the spiced apple coffeecake, a magically moist and subtly spiced bit of morning decadence.  I'll have two.

Jeannine's produces a beautifully executed American breakfast, with fresh and perfectly rendered eggs, bacon, sausage, and ham, and homemade biscuits for a nice twist.   This classic, straightforward combination varies dramatically from restaurant to restaurant, and it's always memorable when they get it right.  A final member of the cast was the light, custardy plate of lemon-ricotta-poppyseed pancakes, which would have sufficed on their own with a little butter and syrup, but instead were crowned by homemade blackberry-ginger sauce and a house-whipped Greek yogurt.   Even better than it sounds, I assure you.

This place really is in one of the best areas of Santa Barbara. I really enjoy the ambiance of a French Parisian restaurant that Jeannine's gives off. Do try coming on the weekend, they usually have live guitar playing outside and since it's in the most picturesque part of downtown Santa Barbara, it's a must. 

I like to sit inside when it rains, but even though the outdoor seating has umbrellas, the indoor has a different, more modern ambiance to it. There are many tables indoors and out, but they are not crowded together and there is enough room to order enough food for everyone.

STAFF - 

For some reason, the staff here like to stare - I really don't mind it, except while I eat it's a bit disruptive if I'm out with friends or family - other than that, the service is always tip top and very persistent and accommodating. Even though Jeannine's may be busy at certain times of the day, it's never loud and crowded.

FOOD -

I ordered their Florentine Benedict with salmon (I would greatly recommend adding their salmon or crab to any of their Benedict's - they are absolutely delightful.), and usually order their bottomless mimosas as well whenever I come here for brunch, but also tried their vanilla latte and it was very tasty.

I would definitely recommend coming here if you're a tourist or a local for a nice brunch with friends or family!",2017-02-02 17:14:27

Food came relatively fast and was delivered to our table. We dug right in and it was really delicious! I used the hot sauce for my salad because it was a little lacking in flavor but the poached eggs (for the salad and the Norwegian breakfast) were cooked perfectly! Definitely pretty healthy too.

This was one the top rated & so we made our drive up early one Sunday & popped into downtown for some brekkie. Being Sunday, it was quiet & there wasn't much traffic. Many streets were closed to through traffic to allow social distancing of pedestrian traffic.  Parking was found around the corner & upon arriving, there was naturally a line. It wasn't too long of a wait. Orders are placed at the counter & a number is given to you. You are free to find your own table. There is both indoor & outdoor seating & indoor was ok when we went in October, but I'd check to see what the current situation is. We sat outside, along the side of the building & it's all very pretty. The building has big windows that pretty much open up to the outdoors & views are lovely. Now onto our food!! I had a plate of French toast. Hubby had the breakfast burrito. Yes & yes to both. All the flavors & textures were there. Moistness (I know y'all hate that word but it's important with certain foods) was on point cause I've had many a dry French toast & this wasn't dry. No rubbery burrito here.

The food was so delicious and I LOVE that they serve mimosas as a glass of a champagne and a carafe of OJ, separately. I only like a drop of juice in a mimosa (why water down good champagne?) so I appreciate when they allow you to do it yourself. 
I ordered the Apple French toast and my husband ordered one of the specialty omelettes. We were both happy with our choices, but he was definitely jealous of mine. 
The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the ordering process. The hostess sets you up with a table and then you get in line to order at a counter. The line moves extremely slowly so we waited close to 20 minutes. One person working the register on a Saturday morning just seems inefficient. Plus, you're unable to order drink refills or anything extra because you'd have to wait in the long line again.

Must have: Eggs Benedict - I recommend the classic. And if you really want to have a sweet delight, go for the Waffles. 

Large cup of coffee is more like a huge cup of coffee so go for a small vanilla latte and you won't be disappointed. 

I do appreciate the FRESH squeezed orange juice. Overall, good quality food and great customer service. They have champagne if you are in the mood :).

I went during Sunday Brunch this weekend and it was the PERFECT Opportunity to try this little place out. I like how you are given a table number and then order. I'd rather not have to tip extra for a brunch place with waiter service... Staff was very friendly and efficient, very knowledgable and accommodating. Wait time for the food was about average for how busy/not busy the restaurant was. 

while waiting for food I was able to soak in and observe the atmosphere. It was semi-casual with a bit of sophistication. They fit a lot of modern touches into an otherwise very old Spanish building. A very nice combination, I must say! Acoustics were quite nice, I would recommend a casual business meeting here if needed. 

The people that brought the food were a bit less than friendly, but I forgive them. Food was presented well, ""Jeannine's"" logo was at the top of the plate. Great for picture taking. I ordered the ""French Toast Breakfast"" which I was surprised to say ""I'm full""... It didn't look like a lot of food in the beginning, but after finishing, it was plenty. I enjoyed the fresh-cut fruits, but not so much the Blackberry (Too many seeds for French toast)... Also the potatoes were a bit lack luster on, but a valiant effort with the variety of colored potatoes. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to those looking to chill out a bit. Parking is very convenient and most likely free. the restaurant is also ADA friendly, and offers a wide variety of food to please most to all members in your party.",2018-01-12 04:10:16

The line was already out the door when Jo R. and I arrived at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning. How it works here is that you order for your whole party at the counter, but the folks at the register can split your order so that people can pay for just their portions. Menus are available both up front and outside the venue. It was the morning of the 2nd annual Women's March, which explained the crowd, but the line went by super fast, and before long, we were able to find a two-seater outside to enjoy the rapidly-warming weather.

I tried their new small Havana latte with soy milk. The latte came in a coffee cup larger than I'd expected, with condensed milk and topped with cinnamon sugar. This was what I thought a cinnamon dolce latte at Starbucks would be when I was a kid, and this one tastes way bigger. It was very creamy, despite the use of soy, and I would probably stop by for a to-go latte in the future.

And, in honor of cooking at home all week, I splurged on the lobster Benedict. Like the latte, it exceeded all my expectations. I've never had an eggs Benedict dish with hollandaise that rich and creamy before. In fact, it was so rich that I nearly had to take a nap afterward, even with all that caffeine coursing through my veins. The lobster tails they use are juicy, plump, and sweet, making the hollandaise the perfect complement. Combined with the wispy poached eggs and tall English muffins they used, I feel as if I'll never make or taste an eggs Benedict that will ever top the one the cooks at Jeannine's made. 

Their rainbow potatoes (purple yams and sweet potatoes included) were seasoned nicely, and I loved that the fruit bowl was still full of berries even during a winter month. I wish I'd had the stomach to try some of their baked goods, because those scones and salted caramel bars were tempting me like crazy.

I will sing all of Jeannine's praises for the rest of my time in Santa Barbara. In a way, it was better that brunch cost me $30, because I know I lack the self-control otherwise to stay away from this point forth.",2018-01-22 01:49:53

Positives- the Florentine was amazing!! So delicious, runny yolk, and perfect hollandaise sauce. My friend was also a big fan of her Veggie Benedict. Another friend that ordered the Belgian Waffle said it was the best he had in a while. 

Negative- the blueberry pancakes were okay, not special. I expected fruit and whipped cream on top, and now after leaving I realize that they must've forgotten them??

It didn't seem like there was enough (or any?) dressing on the salad, but I asked for more and a waiter quickly brought me out another container of dressing. 

I felt super healthy drinking water and eating a great salad, but thennnnnnn I tried these little salted caramel bars. They were AMAZING! I could eat them everyyy day. They weren't too big, but they were just the right amount of sweet. They made me wish I had ordered a cup of coffee. I really could have spent all afternoon here!

I recently came to Jeanine's to celebrate my best friend's birthday and we both peach bellinis. I got the Belgian berry waffle and my friend got the poached salmon bagel. Since it was my friend's birthday we received a complimentary slice of cake for her which was very sweet. The patio area is super pretty and the inside of the restaurant is just as pretty.

The toast was crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. The bananas were perfectly cooked and the syrup was sweet and smooth. My other go to is the Classic Eggs Benedict. My friend ordered this and she said it was really good. And I can vouch for her! I have had this multiple times and it's literally so good. The sauce is smooth and creamy and the egg is always perfect poached. Oh and let's not forget about those next level potato's. Here's a pro tip: if your meal does not come with potatoes, order a side of them. They are well seasoned, well cooked, and they mix purple and sweet potatoes in! So yummy. All in all

For breakfast, I just had their toast and jam. It was thick-sliced, pre-buttered, and pre-jammed with my choice of strawberry jam. All top notch ingredients. 

They have a coffee-roasting model where they rotate through different roasters from different geographies.

That is amazing customer service!

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because:
1- There was no creme brulee on the desert menu.  Call it a personal quirk if you will.
2- They shut down relatively early, along with all of the other restaurants in the area...around 8:30-9pm.  I guess that's the status quo for restaurants in this area.  Considering their array of wines, I wish they were open later so that I could have had ""seconds"". :)",2009-11-25 06:54:18

I also had a cappuccino and was pleased to find out they also offer milk alternatives such as almond milk, so I got my cappuccino made with almond milk.

There are 6 flatbread choices, we had the Soppressata and white bean pure, YUM. The flatbread was a generous portion, as were the wine flights. We sat outside on a Friday night and people-watched under heat lamps. I'd definitely go back even without a groupon.

We stumbled upon it by chance while walking down State St. We were greeted by a woman who offered us a table outside. It was a prime spot for people watching, sun bathing, and salad eating. Not long after taking our seats, someone brought us glasses of ice water, each with a slice of cucumber floating underneath the ice. That's right, cucumber. This was exceptional. We immediately knew that we had come to the right place. Neither of us even like cucumber that much, but to have it in the water was original, and added a touch of luxury to what was otherwise an everyday run of the mill glass of ice water. Our waitress came by to take our orders, but we weren't quite ready. My girlfriend wanted the Kale salad with mung beans, but I couldn't decide between the Cobb Salad and the caprese sandwich. Finally I made up my mind and we enjoyed a few more sips of cucumber water before a black shirted man approached the table with a bread basket. There were two kinds of bread, one white and one that looked like some kind of grain bread. The grain bread was fantastic. It was soft and moist. Our waitress returned to take our orders. 10 minutes later we were enjoying a kale salad with mung beans and a Cobb salad while basking in sunlight watching all kinds of people. At this point we knew we had made it in life. All of our personal shortcomings, past failures, missed doctors appointments, and disappointing dining experiences had been superseded by this moment in time. I had ordered a Firestone 805 beer, which I'd never had. It was absolutely delightful. Hoppy, with a hint of citrus, and refreshing, it was everything I wanted from a beer. My girlfriend got a Pinot Gris that was on tap. She loved it. I tasted it. I was blown away. Maybe my mind was still spinning from the water, but I could have sworn there was a hint of cucumber when I smelled the wine. Of course there was no sliced cucumber in the wine, although if there had been, it would have been fine as the wine bistro from this point on could do no wrong. The Cobb salad was perfectly dressed, and the chunks of chicken were perfectly sized so that I didn't have to cut them. The kale salad was wonderfully Asian in that all American way that only happens in California. And I say that possibly because of the mung beans, or the dressing, or because I don't know what else to say. We ate the salads and asked for the check, which was brought to us swiftly. Everything was perfect. We ate everything, except for the cucumber slices in the water and a few chicken chunks. Thank you, Wine Bistro, for a most satisfying dining experience.",2014-01-06 01:23:34

I was seated quickly (Thursday night) and they served me water with a cucumber in it. I didn't even know that was a French way to serve water! 
I decided on the French onion soup. It was very tasty, but sadly not 9$ tasty. 
For my dinner I ordered the Rancho San Julian Burger (sounds more Mexican than French but what do I know, I was born in California). The burger came with a salad that had the perfect amount of ranch. I was so glad because I was afraid that if I ordered more ranch at a French restaurant then I would get slapped. The burger was so juicy! Exactly the flavor that made my mouth water. I would order it again. I ordered mine medium. 

The service was a little slow but I am patient. It means that I got to spend more time in a very relaxing setting with my special someone. 

One thing I noticed right away was that they use imitation French Laguiole knives. I could tell because they said ""china"" on the side. They were still very sharp and cut my burger in no time!

So I go with champagne. 

The mussels with the chorizo are delicious and they don't skimp on the portions. Get plenty of bread because you won't want any of the broth to go to waste. 

Our server/wine aficionado was Kelsey (i think) and she was incredibly helpful for those of us who have to google the correct spelling of ""wine-aficionado"". 

The beet and goat cheese salad was also delicious and the presentation only added to it (sort of a greens/goat cheese/beet tower on a bed of beet slices). 

My only reason for giving this place four stars is the setting. They need to do something to hide the ""back of the house"" operations from the front. The front is open, airy, and classy. 

For that reason, we still do a lot of take out from Pierre Lafond (anything with duck will blow you away, even after 15 minutes in the front seat of your car).

You can easily find an over priced, bland restaurant with even more bland servicing staff on state st of Santa Barbara, but not at Pierre Lafond.

Burger was probably the most perfectly grilled. seasoned one that my husband (burger fever man) ever had. Flat bread I got tasted so fresh you can taste every ingredient instead of overly cheesy, greasy, salty taste. 

As it's been almost a month since our visit here, I forgot what wine we paired with our food but it was excellent as well.
Not to mention complimentary appetizer bread. 
Oh, those were just ridiculously good...

We were surprised that not only the servers but a busser was well-trained. 
As my husband is a manager at a fine dining restaurant, we can usually tell how a restaurant is run just by seating there for 20-30min. Here we could tell they train bussers' language, the way they communicate with customers. 
A lot of restaurants don't even care how servers converse with customers, let alone bussers. 

We went there on Monday night.
Usually restaurants schedule sous chef or training chef for monday night because it's least busiest time. But when we came here on Monday night, without much expectation, we still had as decent food as other fancy places in Beverly Hills or West Hollywood.
They do care about the consistency of their quality food.

This review is long overdue as my colleagues and I were here last summer for business. The first night we were there, we were tired after flying in from Maui all day then driving from LAX, one of my coworkers had been to SB before and said that we should go to this Mexican place on State street - it'll be fun and casual. We get there, the wait staff was utterly rude so we walked on our reservation and Wine Bistro was right next door and could take us right in. 

The Caramelized Onion & Goat Cheese Tart and the cheese platter for appetizers were awesome (we're a wine and cheese kind of group). I don't even remember what we had to eat, but the desserts, these desserts are to die for. We stuffed ourselves, but never turn down the option to at least browse the dessert menu and thank goodness we didn't. Fig Tarte Tatin with Bleu Cheese Ice Cream AND Strawberry Shortcake with Basil Sauce. The four of us shared one of each and loved every last bite of it. The bleu cheese ice cream is not recommended on its own, but with this perfectly balanced fig tarte tatin in its flaky crust - perfect. And I'm not a cake eater. but I love anything basil infused, the shortcake was no exception, the cake itself was very moist which I appreciated, the strawberries were so fresh and delicious, and again the perfect amount of the basil sauce over the strawberries and soaked into the cake was absolutely heavenly!

I should correct that our destination was Solvang. We left Los Angeles a little later than we wanted to and arrived at Santa Barbara a little after noon. Our group stopped in on Santa Barbara's State Street for some lunch. We wandered around looking for the perfect place to dig and after negotiating our way through the tourist, shops, restaurants and after much debate, we found the Pierre Lafond Wine Bistro. We all decided to stroll in. 

First thing I ordered - coffee! I have to say that the portion size for the coffee was quite large. But very good. It was a really delicious cup of coffee. 

Having missed having a breakfast. I noticed that they were still serving brunch/breakfast food. I decided to go with the Bistro Benedict. I'm a fan of poached eggs, English muffins, ham (or pretty much any pig product). It was delicious.....hollindaise sauce was rich, creamy. It was perfect. Went well with the coffee and was the perfect breakfast for a lunch in Santa Barbara.

The service was good. I recall our server being very attentive and friendly, to a bunch of tourists like us. Cause, yeah - we had tourism written all over us. I also liked, not just the decor - but the furniture. We (there's six of us) were seated at a thick glass table. The decor was modern and clean. Yet, I felt very comfortable eating there.  

And yes, I see the irony reader - oddly enough.....none of us got wine, seeing that this a wine bistro. But in our defense - we were heading to Solvang for wine tasting.",2011-02-27 04:25:36

Lovely touch to serve water with cuke slice, so fresh. The bread basket is inspired. We each had a wine flight & enjoyed very much; nice selection, generous glasses. Shared the roasted mushroom, butternut squash & taleggio flatbread, very nice.  The mussels in white wine were the star for us--absolutely incredible.

We were walking around and decided to sit down and have a pair of wine flights. The flights each come with three different wines, so we figured that should be a reasonable amount of wine for two people. So imagine our surprise when the waitress walks out with six glasses of wine, each of them easily 2/3 full. Fortunately, we weren't driving that day, and we damned well weren't going to let good wine go to waste... :)

Fast-forward a bit, I proposed, she said yes, we decided to get married in Santa Barbara. The time came for us to decide on a reception caterer, and so we got in touch with Hilary at Pierre Lafond. She set up an absolutely over-the-top tasting for us. Phenomenal food, incredible wine, and she was on hand throughout the tasting to answer all of our questions.

Surprise surprise, we decided to go with Pierre Lafond for our reception. Hilary was on-site to manage everything, and the whole thing couldn't have gone more smoothly. Our guests raved about the food all weekend, the wine never stood a chance, and Hilary and her staff were on their A-game.

As for suggestions? You can't go wrong with any of the Lafond wines. The goat cheese tart is out of this world. The flatbreads are great for an appetizer, or just as a snack to go with your monster wine flight. All in all, though, it's hard to go wrong here.",2012-05-18 20:56:51

I tad pricey, but it was a good meal and well worth the food and location which was good for people watching.

They have great outdoor seating which is really nice. 

The kabobs were perfectly grilled.  The mussels were good and came with two crustini (sp?).  The pasta was really tasty, but maybe a tad too much truffle oil and it was VERY rich, we couldn't finish the entire dish. 

The service left something slightly to be desired.  They were probably one of the busier restaurants on State St. and maybe they didn't expect to be that busy b/c they under staffed by one server.

Mournful, monotonous, and superficial though it may be, it is paradise. There is no other -- Jean Baudrillard quotes 

Is Santa Barbara a paradise?  Depends on your perspective of course.  Certainly both the best and worst of the West...gorgeous scenery and weather mixed with obscene wealth counterbalanced by an increasing homeless population.  Meanwhile the middle and upper middle classes who do the real work struggle to afford to live here.  

And yet this is still a favorite day trip...the hiking is solid, the wineries are to notch although the restaurants are just now catching up.  And the people watching on a beautiful Spring day sitting on the patio of a joint like Pierre Lafond is priceless.  Gorgeous women and men...not so gorgeous women and men who think they are gorgeous :)  The homeless of course both talkative and benign and mean and threatening.  Low riders with sun glass wearing dogs in passenger seats.  European and Asian tourists with filled shopping bags.  Teenagers and tweens acting cool.  Southern California does not have a great urban environment but the people watching diaspora can be just as fun at a place like SB (if a little less diverse).

As for the Bistro itself, the wine selection here is ample and consists of more than just wines from Lafond's Santa Barbara Winery.  They also have closeout pricing on wines and we sat on the patio with a $19.00 Brassfield Sauvignon Blanc with flatbread & hummus (both very good).    The interior bar is clean, modern and hip but why sit inside on a day like today?

This past weekend there was construction to redo the sidewalks on their block, so no outside tables but I'm sure they'll be back. My veggie delight bagel sandwich was delightful indeed and the eggs were cooked just as requested. I tried my man's corncakes with blueberries and they were scrumptious- a nice change from the traditional pancake (although they have those too). Everything's a bit overpriced but that's how it is in Santa Barbara. Excelllent yet laid-back service. When the outside tables are back, it's the perfect spot to enjoy the late morning sun, a fresh and tasty breakfast, and people-watching galore.",2007-03-20 16:46:23

Our experience here exceeded any expectations we may have had!  The dinner included our choice of two flatbreads, two entrees, and two desserts.  Our server, who was amazing the entire time, took the time to explain all of our options and also explained that we got to choose two wines (2 oz pours) for our wine flight.  Most of us chose to include a zin blend for one of our wine pours.  Shortly after we placed this order someone else came up (either the manager or another server) and apologized for the fact that they were out of that particular wine.  He generously offered to bring over the two bottles that they did have of the blend and we could make our own blend.  He proceeded to place a bottle of Primitivo and Sangiovese (both Santa Barbara Winery) on our table, stating ""scout's honor.""  We poured our blends (and then some), politely telling him the next time he walked by that we were being tempted with the bottles sitting on our table.  He stated ""ah, we don't mind you tempting yourselves a little more.""  So not only were they completely generous with their wine, but the Primitivo was simply amazing!! 

For our flatbreads I ordered the pesto, goat cheese tomato, which was AWESOME...the goat cheese was so creamy. My boyfriend ordered the smoked chicken roasted red pepper flatbread which he also enjoyed.   They were very generous portions as well. For my entree  I ordered the Seared Sea Scallops with asparagus, sweet potato, mushroom rissoto for my entree and what a treat!!  The sea scallops were cooked perfectly and although the risotto was heavy for my liking, it was absolutely delicious.  The lobster sauce made that entrée! While I don't eat red meat, my boyfriend was raving about his NY strip steak and stated it was cooked perfectly.  The best part by far were the desserts...oh...my...god!!  The voucher was only good for two desserts on their menu so we split both.  The molten chocolate lava cake was sinfully delicious.  The sherry wine cake looked so simplistic, but let me just say...WOW!!  We all couldn't stop eating it.  It was like a hot, sugary, melt in your mouth sponge cake.  Even that description doesn't do it justice so just do yourself a favor and indulge!!

Aside from the coffee they also have a small menu of brunch items and pastries, with omni and veg options. One of the times I've been I had their chia porridge with berries and house pecan milk; I definitely recommend.

i don't remember any of the service (i think it was decent, friendly) or what the place really looked like (i think it was fairly standard, nothing crazy).  i was too focused on that lamb.

in fact, all of the dishes were pretty good. i knew it would be a good meal when they brought out warm, yes warm!, nutty bread. yum. then, we got for starters the pork ravioli, which was interesting but perhaps not a necessary order, and the arugula flatbread, which was really tasty.  for his entree, kevin had the duck 2 ways - confit & grilled. really good. for a salt fiend like myself, it was perfect. im not a huge duck fan and i enjoyed the dish.  kevin thought it was a bit salty, though. it sat in this sweet delicious carrot? puree, though, which was really stand-out.

would i return? hells. yes. i ate every last drop of food on all of the plates brought out.  i didnt even have room for my wine.  when janani s. leaves her wine un-drunk, you know the food is good.

& oh, i forgot to mention - the reason we chose this place is because of their puppy-friendly patio, equipped with heaters.  ultimately, we opted to sit inside and leave the puppy in the car because it was raining and miserably cold.  but if it had been a nice warm evening, the patio would have been lovely.",2010-12-02 01:15:23

As per usual, I left late and hit traffic, thinking it would be lovely to take PCH as much as possible. Lesson learned - PCH is not worth the traffic until after Santa Monica. So after an (unnecessary albeit often beautiful) 8 hour drive, I cruise in to SB, check in to my hotel, smuggle my dog in and back out and look to find some eats. 

Luckily I had done my Yelp research and knew that Pierre Lafonde was one of few places that would allow my pupster on the patio. True the the reviews, the atmosphere is sophisticated and cleanly designed, the service was very friendly, and the food was great! I started with a glass of the Santa Barbara Winery Sauvignon Blanc and on the suggestion of my (very cute) waiter, ordered the prawn and artichoke pesto flatbread. Ate the entire thing, save one bite that I had to give the pooch for being such a good passenger all day.  I heard the next table over discussing the dessert menu (fig tartine with blue cheese ice cream?!?!) but was just too full. 

Thanks Yelp, for another perfect recommendation.",2009-07-27 05:36:16

-f_yh4f4lkuxNsFlWkJrvA,W83aZrDrYKwycCHB_eOYYg,m4xrhESFLaA7PiddXeg2aw,5,1,0,1,"The ""new Piatti"" (but don't call it that because this place blows Piatti out of the proverbial water) is a joy. 

Piatti was the first place in SB I ate after I took the graduate fellowship at UCSB. It remained the prettiest fine dining Italian in SB but I never thought it held a candle (apparently Sandy has deluged my language or consciousness with water imagery) to Ca Dario, Tre Lune/Bucatini (same owners) or Via Vai. 

The big draw of Piatti: the rustic beauty of the large, expansive space in the Upper Village of Montecito. I loved the bread and the spicy balsamic/chili flake dipping sauce with a bit of oil. And the 7/glass Piatti house cab was great. Lasagna good. But I had mediocre meal after mediocre meal there and gave up on it except for wine and bread at the bar. 

The Wine Bistro is even more beautiful than Piatti with an impressive open kitchen where the wood fired pizzas are lovingly made by the great kitchen staff. I went for the first time to brunch last weekend and it was quite possibly the best brunch, aside from Four Seasons (expensive and buffet-style so inherently unhealthy), I've eaten in SB. 

The choices were plentiful but I went with the autumn squash, goat cheese, truffle oil, mushroom and sage pizza and I ate twice as much as I intended. I drank the cheapest white by the glass, a perfectly respectable Pinot Grigio (or Gris maybe) at 8/glass. 

There were half a dozen things which tempted me including the chicken cacciatore and the avocado/beet/peppers/goat cheese sandwich on focaccia 

I've been there for dinner and the summer succotash and gazpacho are wonderful. The paintings are a perfect complement to the slightly less Italian but still rustic space with the Mexican tile from Piatti preserved (terra cotta). 

Each room is slightly different and I thought the service was great. Some people remain from the old Piatti which was a real hangout for the 50 to 60 Montecito divorced/married male set (they alternated between Lucky and Piatti and Montecito is so small it was very easy to identify a core group of regulars shuttling back and forth).

Lucky is so expensive and good but the young people (30s) who go there tend to be the most annoying SB 30-somethings, trying to prove they have vastly more money than they do. Then they post pictures on Facebook: ""I'm at Lucky!"" Not to be mean but it's always the most annoying, pretentious youngish people on SB Facebook who ""check-in"" at Lucky, passing themselves off as 50-somethings who have made it and can really afford to eat there (those people of course don't ""check in"" to say they're dropping X dollars on dinner that night) :) 

Don't get me wrong: Lucky is great (when someone else is paying) and the brunch is not that bad, depending upon how you drink (Mimosa or Bloody Mary). The best brunch in SB , hands down, for value and quality is Blush SB. 

This is not a prix fixe with bottomless kind of place. But Wine Bistro is a wonderful addition to the stable of farm-to-table restaurants in SB and I will be back for sure.

(P.S. Happy Hour is reportedly great. I have seen (and smelled) the sea bass and it looks scrumptious. The nice thing about WB is you can moderate spending. Pizzas are the bargain, fish the splurgy dishes. Pastas are moderate and the sides are tremendous and make a nice light, healthy meal.)",2012-11-03 00:08:40

Like any new spot, the first few months is spent iterating and refining. Too many customers feeling so entitled to cheap, delicious, perfect food. 

Small business are much more than just that. They're an effort to create something that didn't exist before for a segment of the market.

I think they've done just that. A cozy quaint spot that craftily manages to feel spacious and refreshing. Great coffee and pastries. Not sure about the food as we didn't get a chance to try.

Last week Frances was waiting on a consistent flow of customers with grace, patience and ease.

***

Update 7/12/13: This place has a recurring problem with a sewage smell that permeates the restaurant.  The last time I was there, I asked an employee about it, and he said they knew about the problem, it had something to do with the pipes that ran underneath the floor, and they were trying to figure out how to fix it.  If they can't figure it out, I think they need to do something more drastic.  Close the restaurant for a while and bring experts in to redo the entire piping/water/sewage system.  As it is, it's very unpleasant and likely unhealthy to go into the store and breathe the sewage smell.

Other nearby stores (Chipotle, See's, etc.) in the same building don't have this problem, so there's definitely something wrong with this store. 

***

I'm happy this Panera has finally opened.  My favorite sandwiches here are the Asiago Roast Beef and the Napa Almond Chicken Salad.  The french baguettes are really good.  The salads are good when the lettuce is fresh, but I have gotten not-so-fresh lettuce a time or two.  I also haven't found any soups or pastries to write home about.

The service at this location has gotten a lot better and faster since the opening days, but they still need to work more on making the orders accurately.  If you modify a sandwich by taking an ingredient or two out, they make it wrong half the time, often making the standard sandwich with no changes.  I've even ordered the standard sandwich with no changes and had them add an ingredient that wasn't supposed to be in there!  This can be easily fixed if you're eating in but not if you ordered take-out.  I often don't discover the mistake until much later, and then I'm stuck with it.",2012-04-26 17:17:03

something that definitely stands out to me here is the amazing customer service. the workers here are extremely friendly- one of them offered to take a picture for me and my friend drinking our coffees, which we thought was super cute :') 

i am so glad i tried cafe ana, because it's a relaxing place to study and grab a cute bite to eat for a reasonable price, has 11/10 aesthetics and overall vibes, and is super convenient to the downtown bus stop. definitely will become a regular here now !!",2019-05-07 04:02:10

THE FOOD -

More often than not, simplicity pays off a lot more than when you try to be experimental in the restaurant world and that was my exact reaction when I took a bite out of their Bacon Egg and Avocado Sandwich. It was very messy, and I enjoyed every bit of it. I did not notice that they had extra silverware and napkins on the side table near me so I tried my very best not to make a mess but I just happen to do so!

So relived and delighted....they serve REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD COFFEE here!!!   Organic, well roasted &  brewed, served in elegant tall mugs. Hot, strong, solid. 
Their pastries, though selection is small, are refined and divine. 
Such attention to detail and excellent quality wins me over. 
The cookies are moist and  flavorful, simply great. 
Atmosphere is airy and elegant if not a  little spare.  Really like all the windows. Big warm wood table with stools is a great spot to read, write, eat, and of course, drink their excellent coffee.   They have beer, wine, and other lovely things to drink too.
This strikes me as a good place  for a  business meeting  lunch.

They strive to be an elevated, more European all-day coffee house with upscale food options and wine, varying from local to international. Also, the evening menu has caviar and roe! I'm unsure of how this will go over but I applaud them. For the less adventurous, Cafe Ana serves pastries, sandwiches, soups, salads, and brunch on the weekends.

I stopped in here for a oat milk vanilla latte (so cliché, I know) while I was planning an upcoming trip itinerary on my laptop (free wi-fi!). Their coffee/espresso comes from Lamill out of Los Angeles and they produce a special blend for Cafe Ana. The coffee was decent, not too bold or too weak. The froth on top was well done and picturesque.

I was also recently was informed on their absurdly inexpensive pints! $5 for a Common Lemon Cider Pint? Rock on! They also have a delicious Honey Hips Blonde that is 8.2 %. Tastes light but gives off a great buzz - How can you complain!

To me, Paneras are a cold weather kinda place - you know, the spot you go to warm yourself up in a cozy atmosphere with a savory bowl of soup. For some reason, their Broccoli Cheddar soup always seems to put a smile on my face. There have never been exceptions to this. 

This particular location is adjacent to a popular mall with ample parking. The restaurant itself is spacious, but not always the cleanest. However, it's never felt dirty to the point of me not wanting to eat there. I'm usually able to cozy up in a comfy booth with my number as I wait for my order to be delivered. 

The service and food are on par with other Panera locations: not the greatest but enjoyable enough. I like ordering the ""Pick 2"" deal where I can get a half sandwich plus a bowl of soup. The food has always been satisfactory to me and really does hit the spot on a cold winter day.

It's fun to try the different things they offer on tap like cold brew, kombucha, cereal milk (looool). Expect to pay for the quality and experience so you're running up about 4.50 for a cold brew. They offer food and pastries and it's a nice and fancy place to stop by for a quick snack. I've tried their $5 truffle fries. Satisfying size for two people and guess what? They're curly fries. 

I don't know if you've ever had a munchie run for jack in the box curly fries and ended up with a few straight cut fries in the paper. It's a real satisfying experience. Rebar offers the amped up version. Found one straight cut fry and a massive potato wedge in my curly fries that I guessed was a garnish? I was so excited.

Rebar serves delicious drip coffee, lattes, and cold brew. They have an assortment of bottled, cold beverages, as well as, local beer and wine. They also offer fresh squeezed orange and tomato juices. 

On a hot day, I usually opt for the cold brew. It is rich, bold and tasty! When I'm looking to warm up, I tend to order an Almond Milk Latte - sooo good! Or an Almond Milk Vanilla Latte, made with a touch of their house made Vanilla Bean Syrup. I am so delighted that they make their syrups in house rather than using the ordinary Torani brand syrups. 

Rebar offers breakfast daily, fresh baked pastries and lunch items including massive, gourmet burgers with fries, pizzas and salads. 

I've had the Sticky Bun multiple times and it is the dessert sweet dreams are made of! Imagine a cinnamon bun but better, doughy on the inside, crispy, perfectly caramelized crust on the outside, topped with candied nuts and a sauce that trickles down the outside ridges of the crust, mmmm good! 

I also highly recommend the Ricotta toast which consists of an extra thick slice of fresh baked bread, topped with a generous slather of hand pulled ricotta cheese and finished off with a layer of jam of your choice (Blueberry Strawberry, Strawberry Rhubarb, Peach or Honey). I had it with Strawberry Rhubarb and it was fantastic! Not too sweet and very filling. It could be a light meal on it's own or order one to share as a little amuse bouche for your table. 

The Avocado Bacon & Egg Sandwich is definitely worth a mention as well. House made Brioche bun, baked to golden perfection, sandwiching a fried egg over medium, several slices of thick, smokey bacon, smashed fresh avocado and topped with diced chives. The sandwich comes with a Chipotle Ketchup that I've heard is wonderful, however, I love a combination of sweet and savory for breakfast so I substitute the ketchup for house made jam, usually Strawberry Rhubarb. It's heavenly! If you've ever had the breakfast sandwich at Renaud's, this is reminiscent of that (only slightly different ingredients), and served with a much better bread in my opinion, because the brioche does not tear up my gums like the bread at Renaud's does. Just try it, it's worth it!

It would not be a complete review without mentioning the ambiance, decor, location and music. Rebar feels like a respite from the hustle and bustle of State Street, even though it's located right on it. Walking into Rebar is like stepping back in time to the Prohibition-Era. Natural wood, metal and steel accents, the greatest jazz humming through unseen speakers and beautiful large windows to people watch. 

There is also a huge, dog friendly outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables. They'll even bring a water bowl for your pooch(es). I know because I've brought my two loves. ;) 

The staff is warm and friendly. They all seem very well-trained. There is free wifi, password: 214union. 

Parking is easy in their lot adjacent to Rebar, or if necessary, you can park across the street in the Amtrak lot where the first 75 mins are free.

The only note I have of constructive feedback is regarding the bathrooms, which are located next to the patio and across from the kitchen doors. They are often dirty and need regular attention. I suggest having an hourly or bi-hourly schedule for the staff to check the bathrooms and do any clean up necessary. It is very off putting when a bathroom is in disgusting condition at a restaurant because it gives off a vibe of uncleanliness. Something I would not associated with my restaurant if I owned one.

This location is housed in the Santa Barbara Public Market. If you chose to park in their lot it is $5 minimum. Ummm no thanks! We drove around and found street parking. Enjoy Cupcakes is located to your right when you walk in - I believe they were the second vendor on the left side of the walkway. 

They change their flavors weekly. The flight is six mini cupcakes served to you in a cute egg crate. We bought two of them, one for us, one for his brother who was watching our house while we were out of town. $20 even for the two flights, in and out in less than 2 minutes!

The flavors we got were:

Chocolate Blackberry Syrah (Signature Flavor) - Chocolate syrah cake, filled with dark chocolate fudge, topped with blackberry frosting and a syrah soaked blackberry that's rolled in sugar crystals

Blueberry Lemon Lavender Chardonnay - Chardonnay cake, filled with lemon lavender infused curd, topped with blueberry frosting 

Ridiculous - Chocolate cake, filled with salted caramel, topped with peanut butter frosting, chocolate sauce, more salted caramel 

Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - Vanilla cake, with a creme brulee filling, topped with vanilla bean frosting & caramelized sugar pieces

Mint Chocolate Chip - Chocolate cake, filled with mint fudge, topped with mint chocolate chip frosting

The Caribbean - Vanilla cake, filled with pineapple banana, rum jam, topped with coconut cream frosting

We found the vanilla cupcakes to be more moist and flavorful than the chocolate ones. Hands down absolute favorite for both of us was the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - I would eat that all the time if I could! I think the Blueberry Lemon Lavender Chardonnay was my second favorite.

I was enjoying some more wine at a local late-night bar with my girlfriends and two of us (myself and my friend Jenn) were craving something sweet, like cake. So our fabulous foodie friend Lorrie all of a sudden tells us, ""Hold on, I'll be right back!"" And runs off into the night. We sat there at the bar somewhat confused, but shrugged and continued to chat it up with the lovely bartenders.

About 15 min later, Lorrie returns with a cute little egg carton. We opened it up like it was Christmas morning and voila 6 cute little cupcakes of all sorts sat in this carton. I tried at least 3 flavors and loved them all but my fave has to be their Signature Chocolate Blackberry Syrah which was chocolate syrah cake, filled with dark chocolate fudge, topped with blackberry frosting and a syrah soaked blackberry that's rolled in sugar crystals.

I tried the cupcake flight, which was an aesthetic/tastebud delight. 6 mini cupcakes are boxed in a half-dozen egg carton. How creative and cool is that? I shared this with a friend, so each of us got literally 3 bites worth of cupcake. But each bite was so good! Every cupcake was super sweet but not overwhelmingly so (maybe because we didn't have that much of it). Each cupcake also had their own distinct flavor as well, and in addition to delicately pipped frosting on top, there was also a bit of a filling. I particularly enjoyed the chocolate blackberry syrah cupcake. The fruity flavor, while sweet, helped tone down the heaviness of everything else. The blueberry blood orange chardonnay was also really nice. It reminds me of a tart, lemon flavored cupcake, but wayyyy better.

I stumbled across this company on Instagram a couple years ago before ever moving to California.  I was obsessed with their unique flavor combinations and cake decorating.  I could do nothing more than drool on my phone screen.

I admit cupcakes are my favorite food group.  I consider my self a connoisseur... And don't hesitate to throw out calories that are mediocre.  

Once we relocated to California last summer, I was determined to road trip and experience these cuppies first hand.  I was driving an hour and 40 minutes to the Los Olivos location until this new spot opened... Cut 40 minutes from my drive!  Yay!

It is probably a good thing they aren't closer to me because I would have no self control and be indulging in every weekly flight.  
~although, if you ever want to open a westlake village location, I would be happy to help with that venture!~

I love how they use fresh, seasonal ingredients in each weekly flight.  Simply delightful!  So far, I haven't met a flavor combo that I didn't like.  My husband may be setting up an intervention for me fairly soon.

They don't ""card"" you for these cupcakes but they're a decent taste to not even get you cupcake wasted! View the menu. If you do want to get cupcake wasted, their term for ""flight"" means one of each mini cupcake, not one of each wine taster, silly (they don't even sell wine here).

A friend of mine was ranting about this place so I've been meaning to try it out. I had no idea while I was only walking into SBPM for the artisanal ice cream, this place is literally right across it!

Verdict: Why not make them regular sized cupcakes at the bakery?! My tastebuds wanted more than a mini, but I guess that's a good thing. That's why I opted for the ""flight."" Cute egg crates just for a pack of 6 ($10). I bought another one for my friend who recommended this place only to give it as a thank you gift. I can't seem to describe all these cupcakes (Cookies & Cream, Raspberry Pineapple Lemon Chardonnay, Triple Chocolate mousse, Peanut Butter Cheesecake, Chocolate Blackberry Syrah, & Sugar Daddy) separately, but the way these are made definitely well worth the title, ""Enjoy."" My favorite is the Chocolate Blackberry Syrah, a quite surprising Syrah taste before & after.

Additional menu options: cake puddings, cakes, mousse cups, & drinks

They also do preorders for special occasions as well. I'd definitely recommend them!

Despite the name I fell in love with the double stuffed cookies and never tried the cupcakes. Found this place on Yelp and knew I had to try it because of the amazing ratings and boy did it not disappoint. In fact, it was better than I ever could've expected. On my 1st trip here I got the double stuffed cookie with cookie dough and chocolate gnache. Choosing just 1 cookie was tough but I knew it was a good choice. When the cashier handed me the cookie I couldn't believe how heavy the cookie was. I love dessert though so this pumped me up! 

My 1st bite of this cookie was divine and every bite after I loved just as much as the 1st. Each cookie was so soft and chewy, and the inside cookie dough was amazing. The chocolate gnache was just 1 extra treat that sent this cookie over the top. Even though it was big I had no problems finishing it and was immediately in love. I even think it might be the best cookie I have ever eaten!!! 

Since I was just visiting Santa Barbara I knew I had to get another one of these - so the next day my friend and I split the one with icing stuffing and it was so great too. Not quite as good as the cookie dough but a very close 2nd. And just to make sure we got our fair share of these cookies we bought 1 more cookie dough stuffed one to go for the next day!

The flavors are layered with the cake having  different flavor and intensity than the toppings and frosting.  For example, the chardonnay basil cupcake features a very prominent wine flavored cake paired with an intense basil flavored curd and rich strawberry basil frosting.

Anyway, Greenstar is super rich and smooth, no burnt Black Russian taste like Starbucks. Only negative about this spot is that when I went in at night and wanted a decaf, the barista said he could only do a decaf americano at this hour. Hmm why wouldn't a coffee shop have decaf in the evening? It's a trend though, I know it'd probably get tossed out, but at least offer to make a pour-over?

I didn't see the appeal, cupcakes as they were made at sprinkles were practically a meal in and of themselves. Though they had interesting sounding flavors, they were oftentimes so sickly sweet you couldn't more than one or two bites before you felt sugared-out.

Flash forward to the opening of the public market and man, has my view of cupcakes been changed! I loved every flavor of the flight, with favorites being the lemon lavender Chardonnay (which I mistakenly thought at first was an actual glass of lemon lavender Chardonnay to go with the cupcakes HAHA. But a girl can wish right?) and the salted caramel pretzel cupcake. 

What I love about these cupcakes is the size, intricacy and uniqueness of each cupcake in the flight. It was a delight to look at, but even more of a delight to eat them. Moist, with a delicious cream in the middle that leaves you feeling surprised that it's so good. 

I took my flight in the cute little egg carton that they package the cupcakes in to go urban wine tasting and had many people ask me where I had gotten all those lovely looking cupcakes from.

My husband and I live in Los Angeles but got married in Santa Barbara, and we wanted to have an original, delicious wedding cake that was over-the-top in *flavor* rather than looks.  We called the Public Market location and set up a time to come in and taste the weekly cupcake flavors.  The owner, Amber, can do ANY of her cupcake flavors as a cake!  The cupcakes are so moist, fresh, and amazing- and the toppings and flavor combinations make you feel like you are in a 5-star restaurant that specializes on cupcakes rather than entrees.  Just ridiculous.  What's more- Amber sent us the list of over 800 flavor combos for us to choose from for our wedding cake!  We ended up ordering a two-tier chocolate cake with brown butter cookie dough, toffee sauce, and vanilla icing.  Our guests were blown away, and even at our own cake cutting at the wedding I had a moment of ""wow that is SO good"" after my husband fed it to me, and I had to mentally re-focus on the moment of what I was supposed to be doing as the bride!  The cake was incredibly reasonably priced - much less than we would have paid at any bakery or wedding bakery, and without a doubt more tasty!!!  Any time we are in the Santa Barbara area, we will come by to pick up some cupcakes.  And even better, when we go wine tasting we will hit up Sarloos & Sons to do the cupcake pairing with the wine tasting (and they have a photo booth!).  Amber has it figured out.

I was determined to go beyond the status quo and get a delicious wedding cake. I heard great things about Enjoy and decided to use them for our wedding day in Santa Barbara on 10.19.19. Such a great decision! We got a three-tier raspberry creme brûlée wedding cake and not only was it beautiful, but it was the most delicious cake I've ever had (and I've had a lot of cake).

Enjoy's cakes have it all: they are elegant, have tons of unique flavor options, the best texture, smooth frosting, and most importantly they are not too sweet, just the perfect amount of sweet. We also ordered their blackberry Syrah cupcakes and chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies. Several days later, guests are still raving about the desserts!

No, I did not win the lotto (I'm still broke).
No, I did not get a much deserved promotion at work (bastards).
No, I did not get married (that dark day came two years later).

What happened was I ate my very first cupcake from Enjoy Cupcakes, the best damn cupcakes on planet earth! After just one bite I knew I was gonna be hooked for life. Enjoy transformed me into the cupcake lover I am today.  

Since that first encounter I've made the long trek from LA to Los Olivos dozens of times just to stuff my pie hole with their scrumptious cuppies. Every time I go, I swear that their cupcakes taste as good or better than the time before. Their cupcakes are the most creative, moist, flavorful I've ever tried, and I've been around the cupcake block a few times, hence the nickname CupcakeCraig. And because they have like a million flavors (550+, but who's counting) I've rarely had the same flavor twice (menu changes weekly). However, they do have a signature flavor that's offered everyday, which is their Chocolate Blackberry Syrah cupcake. Trust me when I say it's as sinfully delicious as it sounds. It's become my all time favorite cupcake. 

Now, fast forward five years to the present, right as Enjoy Cupcakes is celebrating their fifth year anniversary (proud to say I've been a supporter from practically the start), they debut their second location inside of the brand new Santa Barbara Public Market. I love everything about their cute new shop. From the awesome whisk light fixtures, to the cool pick up window and the wooden menu board, everything is absolutely adorable and perfect. 

And the cupcakes, you ask? They're just as good or better than the time before!  

But what I love the most about Enjoy Cupcakes is how the owners and employees of the company have befriended me and treated me like family. Every time I pay the shop a visit I end up chit chatting with Kevin (the face of Enjoy) about food, family and just about anything and everything under the sun. And it's not just Kevin, either. His wife Amber (the Jedi baker) is a total sweetheart,  whose passion and love for baking is evident every time I eat one of their cupcakes. And the ultra talented bakers, Kara and Amber, are two of the raddest girls I've ever met who I keep in contact with via Instagram. All of the great people I just mentioned make me feel like I'm part of the Enjoy family, which is something I cherish.  

Those are the reasons why Enjoy changed my life for the better. They not only opened my eyes on how awesomely delicious and complex cupcakes really are, but they also taught me the importance of being passionate about your craft and also how hard work and dedication pays off. Now that they have a shop in a large city, I'm positive they're gonna be super famous. Their original location has a cult like following, and it's located in a tiny city with a population of less than 2,000 people. Very soon they're going to take over the cupcake scene in Central Cali... Then the world!

I'm so happy for my friends at Enjoy Cupcakes. They deserve all the success that they've earned. I know everyone who eats one of their cupcakes while visiting the Public Market will love them as much as I do. 

And if anyone reading this is wondering why I didn't try to shorten this novel length review, all I can say is that if I did, it wouldn't be a true Craig R review. I'm back, bitc...!",2014-04-15 03:39:56

Blackberry was good! I liked this because the alcohol flavor wasn't overpowering. It was also hiding a sweet spot of chocolate buttercream and mmmm...perfection! Sweet and smooth but not lard. Same with apple cran, very tasty! Cakes are moist enough and not overly sweet which is nice. You can tell they are freshly made.

Pretzel cupcake was very tasty as well. Had a center of caramel. 

Sadly they didn't have gluten-free but that's okay. Not everyone does! They had more than cupcakes too; one of them looked like a cookie dough cookie sandwich, which, hell yeah! Wish i had thought to get it.

We got 2 of each of the remaining flavors, Ginger Tangerine Chardonnay
 and Chocolate Blackberry Syrah. The inclusion of wine was really inventive and worked well. The chardonnay cake had a ginger curd and tangerine buttercream, with a little bit of tang and light sweetness. The cake itself was a nice texture too, light and fluffy.

The chocolate syrah was the better of the two for me - slightly heavier cake base with dark chocolate fudge filling, then topped with frosting. The frosting also had sugar crystals on top which gave it a surprising little bit of a bite.

I liked the egg box as packaging - which helped the last two cakes survive the trip home in my handbag, even after falling over. Impressive.

I wish I could've tried a full flight. Best to get there a little before closing time if you want to try them all.",2019-03-25 22:55:47

I run a nonprofit called the Green Stars Project so I was super-excited to see a place called Green Star Coffee listed in Santa Barbara. My project is all about ethical consumerism, so I went there with a little trepidation, hoping that it would not be the kind of place that serves commodity coffee in Styrofoam cups. Thankfully, I had no cause for concern - they live up to their name :-) More on that in the next paragraph... Overall, I tried coffee in several places in SB - Green Star, Handlebar, Helena Avenue Bakery, and the SB Roasting Co. Of the four of them, I thought Green Star had the best overall experience when you combine quality/experience with sustainability/ethics. I had a small Americano - pretty decent at $2.50, considering it contains two shots of organic, fair trade coffee. Nice Americano: not too weak (thanks to the two shots) and nicely roasted (not over-roasted). The barista was super-friendly. Nice seating area outside the public market. 

I'm also giving Green Star Coffee 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* All of their beans are certified organic and Fair Trade. Most of it is also shade-grown (impt for habitats). 
* I read that one of their suppliers, a coffee farm in Guatemala, was affected by coffee leaf rust. Green Star agreed to pay them higher prices to get them over the difficult patch. They seem like genuinely good guys. 
* It's one of the few places I've come across lately that uses compostable cups. You know regular cups have a plastic lining, right? The vast majority of conventional cups end up in landfill because there's nothing else to do with them. Green Star's hot cup lids and cold cups are also compostable.
* Their milk, sugar and agave are all organic. Plant-based milks available too, naturally. 
* They are a zero-landfill café. They re-use their own coffee bags and everything else is recyclable or compostable.

Equally delicious are the cookie sandwiches. Picture two slightly under baked, soft, gooey chocolate chip cookies sandwiching a large dollop of vanilla icing. Yum, yum, yum!! 

To get the most out of your Enjoy Cupcakes experience, order 1/2 dozen assortment and share with someone, or devour them all if you roll like that! ;)

very, clear day but very humid.  We decided to sit out on the patio.  We  ordered white wine and an appetizer of Irish Soda bread with Irish cheese.

I normally don't like Irish Soda bread...but this was amazing!  The best, I've ever had. Very light, not too dense.  With the perfect amount of Irish cheese.

We were still a couple hours away from going to dinner, so we ordered a cheese plate, with French bread, cheese, nuts and fruit!  Again, so delicious.

Wine was served in nice glasses without the ""lip"".. Very classy.  My parents are from Eastern Europe and drinking from a fine wine glass is hard to come by.  You can always tell, when it's European glass...thin and delicate.

The Service! So, incredibly friendly and sincere.  Our waitress....such a sweet girl!!!! Always making sure, we were taken care of.  At one point the owner, with a nice Irish accent came out, and talked with us for a good 10-15 minutes.  It's the European hospitality, that I'm so familiar with. It's something that can't be taught...it's inherited.  Making you feel at home and completely comfortable.

Lastly, I live literally 33 minutes from this place...and my husband and I have decided to make this a regular stop! Knowing we will be warmly greeted, and enjoy, great food, service and an amazing ambiance!  Can't wait for the next visit.",2014-07-25 06:38:49

We were visiting SB on a girls trip and were looking for a good brunch spot when we happened upon La Arcada Bistro. Immediately, the waiter read our minds and recommended the calamari and brought us some delightful mimosas.

We both ordered the burger which was mind blowing (fun tip, just go all out and add a fried egg.) OH, and the fries. Straight perfection. 

All the food was brought out directly by the chef, who was very nice and attentive.  

Our outdoor table gave us a perfect view of the little street (La Arcada?) which may as well have been straight out of Austria. Amazing lunch. Great time. Great staff.",2017-02-28 03:42:20

They always serve it hot off the oven so it takes a little bit of time to get your order. But the wait is really worth it! 

They serve chicken, beef, and cheese empanadas among others and they serve it classic or gourmet style. I don't exactly know the difference but all I know is that the gourmet empanadas I had were super good and the chimichurri sauce for dipping also makes it 10x better! I would say the chicken is my favorite. 

The servers are very friendly and accommodating. The place I would say is interesting and a little offbeat. To the right is a boutique shop and to the left is the restaurant.

The atmosphere is neat in that it feels like you're in a creative space full of vibrant decor and vintage tableau. The seating area is small but it's got the vibe of a cozy coffee shop with the space doubling as a little shop as well. 

For the food: The empanadas are freshly baked and delicious whether it's gourmet or the classic. The gourmet is flaky and filled with about the same amount as the classic, while the classic has the standard bread and has more air in it. Regardless, both are light and flavorful and there isn't a wrong choice. I had the beef gourmet and the chicken classic, and but I'll definitely be back for more. The filling is indeed, filling, and the sauce meshes with the empanadas well.

I heard this place had opened and was passing by.  They have a little menu out front that caught my eye, so I popped in to check it out.  Then the next day I came back for lunch.

Their main food offering is empanadas.  They have several kinds: chicken, beef, spinach, ham, pepperoni, who knows what else.  These are mysteriously offered in ""classic"" and ""gourmet"" varieties.  As far as I can tell, the classic ones are cheaper and larger, but less fully stuffed, and perhaps with a slightly less delicate crust.  Your empanada order comes with a tasty chimichurri sauce for dipping.  They also have some sweet pastries that I haven't tried yet but that look pretty good, along with coffee and sodas.

I tried the ""gourmet chicken"" as well as the ""classic beef"".  Both were quite tasty, with a nice blend of subtle spices and a thin dough that didn't overpower the filling.  The ""classics"" are $3, which is reasonable; the ""gourmets"" are $3.40, which is a tad high considering they're smaller, but still not outrageous.  Overall a good value when you factor in their tastiness.

The vibe is so eclectic it's difficult to describe.  A huge plush empanada greets you at the doorway.  The walls are painted in large rectangles of different colors, with colored lights carefully positioned to accentuate them.  The tables where you eat are made of out old machinery, car parts, bicycle wheels, and the like.  The walls are decorated with a hodgepodge of kitsch (old license plate, collage-like art, etc.).  Dreamy techno-esque music wafts through the space.  Most unusually, the place is actually two businesses: on one side you have the counter and the seating for the empanaderia/coffee shop, but the other side of the room is a boutique with racks of clothes, handbags, and so forth.  The entire kitchen area is on wheels and appears to be a food truck layout plopped into the building.

It seems like they are still figuring out the logistics of how to operate.  The guy at the counter confirmed the empanadas are prepared elsewhere and cooked on site, but didn't know exactly where they were made.  He took my order, but then had to come back and tell me one of the ones I ordered actually wasn't available.  (He handled it fine by substituting a ""classic"" for the ""gourmet"" and refunded me the price difference.)  When asked if they had a bathroom, he hesitated before saying no.  He (as well as another woman working) there were very friendly though.  They seem to have put a great deal of care into the decoration and marketing (the printed menus are unusually nice-looking for such a modest establishment).

Overall I enjoyed Tangonadas.  The empanadas are tasty, and I can definitely see myself returning for more.  I'd also like to try their sweet pastries.  I do have one piece of advice for Tangonadas, though: you will not succeed as a coffee shop if you don't have a bathroom.  Other than that, it's a pleasantly funky place to grab a snack.",2017-02-21 22:27:29
L5VIX0AlRMKrRP4Yu3t6MQ,A4bsa7ykYRVCnb4h2vZALw,Kg71HUigI1rnY3UMFiLx0w,4,83,63,79,"Tangonadas is the newest addition to State Street serving up freshly made empanadas and pastries. 

This place is the cutest! It's very small inside and not only do they sell food but it's also a unique little shop where you can purchase swim suits, trinkets, costumes, and other interesting little items. The decor is colorful and eclectic. 

They have a few tables outside so you can sit and people watch while enjoying your empanada or pastry. There's also seating provided inside as well. It reminded me of something you'd see at Disneyland very cute! 

Each empanada will cost you $2.99 and the gourmet ones are $3.40. What makes it gourmet? According to the guy behind the counter they are more flavorful, have more Ingredients and slightly bigger in size.

They do offer combos which is a good deal to sample each one. 
~ 3 empanadas of your choice + soda or coffee for $8.99 or $9.99 for ""Gourmet""

Choices are as follows: 
Chicken
Beef
Spinach & Cheese
Special/Seasonal of the day 

I opted for the gourmet chicken and regular spinach cheese empanada. I was a little disappointed in the gourmet chicken as it seemed a little skimpy filling wise but the size was slightly bigger and the crust was thicker. But I'm starting to think maybe they gave me the regular one? The spinach & cheese had more filling than the chicken and it wasn't gourmet. Both had good flavor though and the chimichurri served with them gave it a nice kick. 

I also purchased two small pastries to take home. They were the perfect treat to satisfy my sweets craving. Light, airy, flaky pastry with yummy fruit filling. I wanted the guayaba cream cheese one but unfortunately it wasn't available even though they displayed a full tray of it I was told that it was ""Sold"" and not something I could purchase. 

Overall these empanadas were freshly made and served warm and toasty. The perfect snack to try if you're on the go! I definitely will return to try the beef empanada and get that guayaba cream cheese pastry.",2017-03-26 15:43:31

D5eFRhoKo9zCsnDcRzlWLA,ncNj3UykcOPA4abKe5pNbg,Kg71HUigI1rnY3UMFiLx0w,4,5,0,2,"I was excited to try this place since I've only been eating Filipino empanadas my whole life. Argentine empanadas are on a whole other level (sorry to bust my roots). The shop is cute. Half boutique, half cafe. It's a little cramped to get through once there's more than 2 people in line. The decorations are adorable, and it feels like you're hanging out in a mini town when you sit inside. The people working there are extremely friendly and we're very attentive to the other customers who may not have had a lot of exposure to empanadas. 

They have 2 categories of regular and gourmet. Combo deals only cater towards one category so you can't mix the menus unless you buy them individually. I opted for a 3-empanada gourmet combo with coffee. Coffee was average alone, and they have a bar with assorted creamers if you're into that. The empanadas I decided to try were the gourmet beef, chicken, and caprese. They heat them to order, and the caprese did add a 10 minute wait.

Were they worth it? Definitely. My problem with empanadas is that maybe the dough is too thick or isn't flakey enough, but this was not a problem here. The chicken was seasoned and there were chopped tomatoes in it. Beef had potatoes and olives. Caprese was, well, caprese. Not quite traditional for me, but it was my favorite next to the chicken. It was like eating a huge ravioli with empanada dough, and it was honestly the best empanada experience I've had. 

I liked this place, and I could return to try the rest. It is a little expensive at 3-4 bucks a pop for small empanadas, but a good experience overall.",2017-03-01 22:09:02

They baked the empanada in small batches and they all came to the table hot and fresh.  The classic empanada had a thinner crust while the gourmet empanada had a flaky crust .  The beef filling was perfectly spiced and had moderate amount of rich and savory juice.  Just like eating a Chinese dumpling, If you let it sit for awhile, the juice will reabsorb back into the meat and will not be as delicious.  The side of chimichurri was garlicky and herbaceous.  I will definitely come back to try the other flavors.  I am deducting one star because they forgot about my order.  Maybe they should give each customer a number to streamline the ordering process.  Furthermore, every single person who came in asked about the difference between classic and gourmet.  They should consider adding that information to the menu.",2017-03-21 00:47:39

Its been so many iterations in the past that I just didn't notice when another popped up. Fortunately a friend of mine did notice and she booked our annual Holiday dinner there for a group of 9. Nothing about the look of the place will tell you this but the menu has a bit of an Irish bent to it featuring Irish Oatmeal and something called a ""Traditional Irish Breakfast"" (eggs, Irish Bacon, Sausages, Black and White Pudding, Tomatoes, Mushrooms & sweet Irish Soda Bread) on the breakfast front while offering Shepherds Pie on the dinner side. There is also a wide range of classic dishes form other cuisines ranging from shrimp scampi and chicken piccata to New York steak and a decent looking burger. Throw in a quesadilla and some nachos just to round of the international flair and flavor of the menu :-) We got an outdoor table which was quasi-indoor thanks to an awning,  clear plastic sheeting, and nice space heaters that kept us sheltered from the cold and a rare rainy night in town :-) There were a couple other large groups in that evening but we had a dedicated server and the manager/boss/owner also helped out with our group so service was fine, though one order got misplaced and arrived quite late but we were comped for it and everyone was fine with that. Food wise, I opted for the Shepherds Pie which I really enjoyed. It was nice to find something so totally different on a menu for a change. Others in the group went with the classics like the Piccata, Seafood Fettucine and Salmon.               Though I didn't get to taste anyone else's meals, plates were emptied and no complaints were lodged :-) The general consensus was these were solid takes on classic dishes. Good place to go to serve many palates and tastes and with most dishes under $20 the value is reasonable as well. Small but varied selection of local beers on tap. Didn't get to see the wine list as we brought our own, corkage was $15. Live music many nights, usually acoustic guitar with light vocals.",2016-12-19 01:43:01

On a recent trip to SB i took my little nephew (i guess not so little as he is a mighty 5 years old now) to catch a movie at the Paseo Nuevo and while walking around looking for something to nosh afterwords i spied Le Macaron French Pastries.
After having spent some time at the DTLA Bottega Louie i was hooked once again on the exotic, ecstatic, luscious wonder that is the Macaron.
We bought  Belgian Chocolate, Columbian Coffee and Rose Macaron mostly because Noah liked the colors and loves chocolate in almost any form except for the beautiful hand made Ganache Chocolate Cake i made for his birthday last year. I mean that pain he inflicted on me when he nearly spat it out: i can still feel  it as i type this review. This year he gets a Vons cake!
But anyway i digress: he liked all three Macaron though i couldn't tell him he was eating rose water.
As far as i am concerned the Macaron, though they looked beautiful did not have the full bodied flavors of those from Bottega Louie. The best of the three i think is the Rose which is not a flavor to make itself apparent but it does so here.
 I didn't try all of them so i can only comment on the 3.
What i do think is pretty wonderful is the ""French Gelato."" We had the Chocolate of course and it was redolent of very fine Chocolate (callebaut?). The texture was very special: more special than Italian Gelato. It was as if i were eating the thickest French Heavy Cream ever. If you have never tasted European Butter or Cream, particularly French you really need to. It is like nothing produced in the USA.
Ok so after Noah picked me up off the floor after the Gelato tasting we noted that most of what they sell here looks like jewelry: vibrantly colored and decorated. Real show stoppers. 
We took home several Chocolate Croissants which were delicious and took me back to my time in France: flaky, multi-layered from a huge amount of very fine butter.
I will be back. There is much more me to see and experience here.",2017-05-02 04:55:17

I'm from the east coast, where fire pits wouldn't be caught dead at a Dunkin Donuts, so I wasn't sure what to think when we saw a 10-ft long outdoor fire feature. It seemed a little elitist. Plus, it was 90 degrees out, and I couldn't help but think this isn't what we discovered fire for. However, I will say that didn't stop me from buying a ""s'mores"" flavor donut and attempting to roast it on the fire feature, which I now know is frowned upon by the staff.

Further differentiating his DD from those in the east coast is the executive lounge area (pictured) for Gentry and Noblemen, that wasn't labeled as such, but you could just tell a regular customer like myself wasn't allowed in unless I had some sort of access pass. I mean, it was right by the espresso bar, where executive drinks are forged.

I stuck to my class (peon) and ordered an iced coffee and the aforementioned donut. Both were of expected quality. 

The woman in front of me, before I ordered, had what appeared to be an existential crisis re: picking donut flavors, and needed in excess of 5 minutes of mumbling to herself words like ""strawberry"" and ""powdered"" before she was able to compete a six pack. This soured my experience, but was no fault of the DD, or the employee who gave me a shrug and ""I'm sorry"" glance while the woman was occupied looking at the ceiling.",2018-02-18 18:11:42

They had that tell tale crunch on the first bite and then an airy feel through to the creamy filling bursting with flavor.

I was actually really surprised with their coffee, in fact, it's hands down a winner over another corporate coffee chain that has a green logo. I always thought Dunkin Donuts was for old men but this place was hip with a fireplace on State Street, and they actually offer food other than donuts! Croissant sandwiches, for example - so it's not just a breakfast donut place. It's open all day long. It probably won't be a destination place but it's in an amazing location and if you don't like donuts, order just the coffee. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

After the first little bite I definitely understood why it was named #1. So moist yet with the perfect crunch and full of flavor. It. Was. Awesome. If you're looking for a small post meal sweet treat this is your spot! Their macarons are definitely high quality and give just enough sweetness to kick your sweet tooth.

They are clunky and chunky like little footballs, and they pretty much all taste the same except for the ""hint"" of flavor you paid for.
