I was amazed at how much fresh pastries they had and the overall selection of pastries. Also the prices were amazing and I was able to pick up a few pastries for my office. I also got a torta, and I chose the $4.00. This is plenty for one person on lunch and I recommend the tri tip because it is delicious! The torta was tasty and I like mine hot, and it was crispy and yummy. They give you lots of meat, lettuce and tomatoes and cheese, very traditional and very feeling.

The bread was delicious,  the sopressata sandwich was divine, as was the green bean artichoke salad.  I was surprised and disappointed that the salad was not accompanied by 1-2 small slices of the baguette. When asked, the server said I could order a 1/2 loaf of the baguette (which I did), though that ended up being just too much.   Also, I would recommend not slicing the whole 1/2 loaf, rather, just make the single cut and leave it to the customer to tear it apart.... I'm hoping what I brought home will taste as good as those I ate with my salad.  All in all the food was very good and I look forward to returning to test other menu items.",2017-02-16 22:53:26

I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious. 

Overall, I'm a huge fan, I would definitely come back if I visited Santa Barbara again. I wish they had a larger variety of baked goods to try!",2018-10-02 03:39:35

Pros: The bakery is in a shared space with a time tasting place. Its has warehouse, industrial and french vibes. It's beautiful and open! They ah e patio seating and all the seating feels community focused. Both pastry items were delicious, moist and the frosting to cinnamon roll ratio was spot on, the service was fast.

It wasn't big but it was filling and I didn't want to eat a big burrito and feel stuffed anyways so it was perfect. I did ask if they could make an egg, potato and cheese burrito but they said they already have them all made already so I got the bacon sausage burrito and it didn't disappoint. I also ordered a large hazelnut coffee so my total for everything was under $7. Their baked goods looked delicious so I will have to try a couple another time.

The environment inside is very clean and nice. Plenty of small tables. I sat inside and read for about an hour. The owner came up to me and asked if I thought the radio was on too loud since I had been sitting there for a while. I thought that was very considerate of her to ask because they are still new to that location so they are trying to figure out what is going to work best for the new space.

Don't sleep on the Elvis-style banana bread with peppered bacon and peanut butter.  There's enough for left-overs later in the day.

The salmon bagel with pickled onions, fresh dill and cream cheese is perfectly toasted, presented and packed with flavor.

We also loved the green eggs and ham sandwich.  Sky-high fluffy eggs with shaved ham, cheese and green harissa for a spicy/tangy kick.

The coffee was very flavorful as well.

Thank you Helena Ave. Bakery for the great start to our day!",2021-07-31 16:14:04

We got a cinnamon roll and the chicken sandwich to share for breakfast, along with a couple of lattes. The cinnamon roll was massive - great for sharing. Lots of good cinnamon. The chicken sandwich comes on a brioche bun, with bacon and a sweet and spicy jam. The chicken is perfectly cooked, crispy and savory outside and juicy inside.

Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars. 
* The support some local charities and events such as bike to work day and Heal the Oceans. 

Find out more about green-star ratings at Green Stars Project dot org. 

PS: The address is a bit confusing: if you approach from Anacapa Street, make your way past The Lark and you'll find this bakery next to the SB Wine Collective. They share the same space (so you can have wine with your bagel instead of coffee, if you so wish). It's easier to find if you approach from Helena Avenue.",2017-07-25 21:14:20

MvkzsY6BH6Fb5AABgLyAhg,SsgDGJWBNvefjY0z8XsVCQ,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,5,5,4,5,"Helena Avenue Bakery is a must-visit for those looking for a great breakfast place in Santa Barbara. Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

I really wish I had the opportunity to go again during my trip here. When I come back to SB, I will sure try to come early so I can have breakfast here.",2020-12-27 23:41:14
9z8IrcxNTm1J-mGEZzYTYQ,hu53X0AgSKMt8UuHjp5ZLw,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,4,9,1,6,"Every single thing I have had here I have loved! The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome! Overall though, tourists especially, definitely check out this bakery at least once and try a quality baked good!",2017-08-11 18:21:21

They have a mix of outdoor and indoor seating but based on how busy this place was on a Saturday morning, THEY NEED MORE SEATING! Be prepared to get territorial and fight for seating if necessary.

The biscuits were delicious as were the breakfast sandwiches that I ordered. The buns were sooooo soft. Who doesn't like brioche? The only item I'd suggest steering away from are the grits.

If you are vegan, skip the egg (sub Avo) & skip the feta.  Would recommend they offer some non dairy cheese option here..non dairy feta is wonderful.  
As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

I live within walking distance so I turned right back around to go home and placed an online order for pickup ~45 min later. 

We got the elvis style banana bread, wildflower honey ricotta on sourdough toast, and the green eggs and ham on a biscuit. I was most pleasantly surprised by the elvis because it's not something I would have normally ordered but the flavors complemented each other so well and the banana bread itself was great. It was a huge chunk of bread so it was also a more filling dish than I expected. We both loved the ricotta toast, which was light and more dessert like. The sourdough bread was very impressive - very soft on the inside with lots of crunch on the outside. Lastly, the green eggs and ham was great with the green harissa sauce and there was a huge piece of fluffy egg. It's not a sauce I've had before on a breakfast sandwich and I was a fan!

If you see a restaurant called The Lark, keep walking past the patio seating until you see the Santa Barbara Wine Collective. Entrance is the same (same owner actually), and you will see some signs and bread on display. 

On the menu you will find baked goods, pies, drinks, artisan bread, and a limited amount of food items. Breakfast is served all day, they make a great brioche breakfast sandwich and smoked salmon bagel. Lunch starts at 11AM, you can choose from a couple sourdough sandwiches, a cheeseboard, or 
Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2. Maybe too much fluff that didn't need to be there, but a good dish nonetheless. Went well with the iced vanilla latte I ordered.

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalapeño jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway. 

FYI: There's public parking (structure) available within walking distance to the bakery. Check out the photos for the entrance and fried chicken sandwich",2021-12-30 01:34:22

Today I went back and bought one, kinda like ""yeah ill take one of those too"" kinda deal and I have to say they have really improved. It actually has 9/10 flavor instead of the 6.5 from b4 and moist/perfect! As b4 I would say they were a little more on the dry side. Perfectly stacked only difference is the flavor this time was so amazing that I got a new phone 3 months ago and didn't have all my saMe apps re-download that it made me DL yelp just so I can post this review. So from the price which I think is like 4 dollars to the portion/taste & ect I give it a 5/5.  Not only that, that's not what took me there in the 1st place. It was there Tri-Tip Torta! It's perfect!! with always a fresh daily baked Bolillo (bread roll). That's cut in half, put in a toaster oven with the meat and mozzarella cheese on top of the bottom half, toasted then they add pico, lettuce, tomato & pickled jalapeno. If you haven't tried, I highly recommend  because the torta is 10/10 only bummer is they charge for salsa which usually every Mexican joint includes when you purchase food from them. Other then that.

This sandwich is probably going to keep me full until dinner. The biscuit was slightly crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy at the same time.

This chicken is juicy, tender, perfect batter where it's the perfect light airy crunch! No sauce sauce is on it, not needed. Fried bacon on top of the fried chicken and the jalapeño jam sauce (very light) with the brioche bun, is all the flavor it needs!! Bacon is nice and thick. It's not being engulfed with sauce hiding all the imperfection, because it's perfect! The buns is so light and fluffy with the perfect sweetness. 

The challah French toast- perfect sweetness with the honey and the grapefruit is spectacular!!! It's juicy and crunchy. The bread is soooo soft and fluffy.

Please know if you are vegan you can sub eggs for avocado but watch how they ring you up.  The Lovely gal timing me up added $3 for avocado  but she fixed it when I pointed it out as a sub.   

Why not five stars:  $1 extra for non dairy milk option.  To many places have up charges for lactose intolerant folks.  Note: Old town Goleta does NOT upcharge for healthy plant based non dairy milks.

If you want a grown up take on the classic McDonald's Sausage Biscuit. Walk over to Rebar Coffee and Kitchen across the street, order a side of their house made (amazing) sausage patty, then head over to Helena Avenue Bakery and order the Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich. Once you get your sandwich, pry it open, careful not to mess up it's yummy contents and place your Rebar sausage patty inside.

The green eggs and ham on brioche is my go-to; it doesn't taste like any old breakfast sandwich because of that delicious green harissa! I didn't like the farmer's market sandwich on brioche because it was really soggy, perhaps from the Swiss chard.

I recently spent a long weekend in Santa Barbara with my family and close friends that are renting a house in the area for the month.  Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

Ordered the green eggs and ham and it was actually quite filling. The square egg was fluffy and soft. Brioche bun was delicious and has a slight crisp which I loved.

The nice surprise was actually the sourdough bread with olive. It was about $10 (or $12 I can't remember). It's actually sour but not to the point that you get a bitter aftertaste. It's so clearly hand-made since the air bubbles inside are uneven. The bread has a nice crisp on the outside and it's very soft on the inside. Also quite chewy!

This past week I came here with a friend to grab a small bite and to get some work done. I walked in and was greeted right away. While I was trying to figure out what to order the girl at the counter gave me some suggestions as I didn't know what I wanted to order. I ended up going with an Iced Chai Latte and the whipped ricotta and seeded honey combo toast.

The Iced Chai was delicious as always! Came out first which was nice. They soon brought my toast over and I fell in love with it. I loved the whipped ricotta and seeded honey toast!! It was SO delicious! I don't know why I never had tried this earlier. The toast had the perfect amount of cheese and honey. The ricotta tasted so fresh probably was the best I've ever had. I love the seeds in the honey as well. I'm going to ask them next time I go what kind of seeds they are so I can try to make this kind of honey at all.

I stopped here one day for a snack- a handmade churro and chicken verde tamale. They were delicious! I realized after one bite of the churro, that all my churro experiences have been sadly limited to the frozen-reheated varieties from amusement parks. The churros here are made fresh and are sooooo good! With tamales on the brain, I returned and bought a dozen tamales. Froze them and ate them until there was nothing left. Akin to a hungry vampire, I needed my next fix. So I returned for another dozen. Repeat. Repeat. Pause. During the pause, my husband mentioned tamales three times. I can take a hint. So I returned today! Since it's Thanksgiving week, supplies are slim but I was able to procure another dozen Tamales and a bag of cinnamon sticks. They also sell masa in 5 or 10 lb bags, with options including sweet, regular or vegetarian. This is the particularly favorable option for those ambitious enough to make their own delicious homemade tamales or gorditas.

It impressed on me that this was The Standard espresso drink for Australia and New Zealand. 

Over here, Recipes Bakery is the only shop in town that serves it. A flat white is similar to a cappuccino, but instead of a dry foam portion, more microfoam is used, resulting in a smooth velvety texture to the drink, and overall has a sweeter flavor without needing sweetener. 
They also serve the long black, which is similar to americano, except that the espresso is added to hot water after, not the other way around, which preserves the crema. 

If you're an Aussie tourist or expat, or simply wishing for a flat white, this is the place to go. They have it down. I once took some some Aussie guests to this town's most artisinal roasting cafe and we just got blank stares when ordering a flat white. 

Their baked goods are made with organic ingredients, I got the cinnamon roll, still warm with icing. If they want to take the Aussie theme a bit farther and start making Anzac biscuits, I will not protest at all!

Recipes Bakery is a shop, not a sit-down cafe, which is too bad, but that's how they are permitted. So everything is packaged ""to go.""  

One more thing: the whole shop is hyper cutsie. There's a force-field surrounding the place that will separate you from at least half your testosterone upon entering. Much to my surprise I saw one guy in there when I visited. He was sitting in a corner, looking confused, miserable and a little resigned. This is what you'll have to accept for a flat white.

It's just across the street from the Saturday morning farmers market, which is also when they are most busy. Look for the bright pink and white-trimmed cottage.",2012-05-04 17:06:04

Working down the street across from Whole Foods, one would expect I'd be a regular there. The salad bar and sandwiches at WF have repeatedly disappointed, so I find myself walking the half mile trek to Gelson's instead. 

The service at the deli counter is excellent with the staff attentive and quick to get help when a crowd starts forming. My typical lunch consists of a deli sandwich made with Boar's Head meat (excellent quality) with the optional 2 side dishes for only $8.99. The wide selection of sandwiches (custom made or their own creations) and the number of sides available to choose from (mind you, they are limited to sides that are priced under $9) really give you unlimited options. I've sampled a variety of the side dishes (pesto pasta, potato salad, roasted veg, beet salad, couscous salad, fruit salad) and find that I've been rotating through the pesto, roasted veg and fruit salads. Quality and quantity are excellent and I usually have a half sandwich left over for the next day's lunch. 

I do not shop at Gelson's regularly, but I am a huge fan of their deli and would take them, hands down, over Whole Foods, when in need of a *relatively* quick lunch.",2012-04-04 05:07:10

I opted to try out the egg scramble and the cinnamon roll French toast. The ingredients used in both dishes seemed quite fresh and of good quality to begin with. Not sure if they make their own jam, but the strawberry jam was great. The cinnamon roll French toast was nice and fluffy and had a good amount of cinnamon (not overwhelming/underwhelming).

Having to control fat and salt in my 50's I figured out how to make pizza with a minimum of both.  This requires good dough.  Trader Joe's fresh dough is salty, does not stretch, and sometimes has gone around the bend.  Frozen dough (e.g. Bridgeford) has lots of sugar and requires defrosting.  Most recently we tried Whole Foods fresh dough.  It made such a bad pizza crust that my husband wanted to chuck what we did not finish.  I have tried making my own dough from scratch, several times, and am apparently untrainable in this regard.  Gelson's sells the dough it uses to make Wolfgang Puck pizza.  The dough stretches like a dream, is not too salty or sweet, is ready to use right away, and, when cooked on a preheated pizza stone, creates a crust that is crisp underneath and to die for.

There has been much harm done!!! Or rather, there will be much harm done--to my wallet!

I got a valrhona triple chocolate brownie, which had such a perfect consistency to it that I actually favored it and took a while to eat it so that the flavor would last longer, which I don't often do; and I got a chocolate caramel candy with sea salt on it, which was partially melted by the time I got home, but tasted so good and smooth.

I am definitely coming back here. There's so much more to try and they have actual lunch/dinner food that you can get to go!",2015-05-06 22:35:23

Prior to our wedding, my wife, her mother, and her maid of honor set up an appointment to do a tasting.

We were told by the staff at Renaud's Patisserie that the patisserie offers more French-style baked goods, such as macarons (though I did also spot some chocolate croissants in the display).

Staff was super friendly and service was efficient. They don't accept Amex even though Gelson's is considered one of the more high-end grocery stores (beats me!), and a sign at the register stated that they no longer accept $100 bills due to the number of circulating counterfeit bills.

You have to exit the store via the front then walk around the side of the house to get there. 

My parents REALLY liked the cinnamon buns, which are a bit crisper without that super doughy center that you'd find in a cinnabon or ikea bun. I thought they were good, but nothing spectacular (I PREFER the doughy center, whilst my parents do not... to each their own!). As others have said, they do Oz style coffee beverages, that are popular all over NZ, Australia, and the UK (the flat white being the best example... it is like a latte, but with less milk). 

Both the breakfast dishes I tried were really good- one was an egg dish with avocado and grilled mushrooms. The other was the pineapple pancakes with coconut and maple syrup. REALLY good. I'd definitely order those again. Our service was really friendly as well.

Nothing could have prepared us for our trip to SB on New Year's Eve. Trying to find a restaurant for dinner was impossible, with restaurants closing early and others needing reservations.
We decided instead to go to Gelson's and see what we could pick up and take back to our hotel room.
We did a loop around the store and decided on the Deli, even though the carving station and soup bars were tempting.
We chose:
Spicy Thai Noodles (because others were buying them and raving over them)
Crab cakes and (Gelson's made) tartar sauce
Lasagna
Pretzel buns
And brownies.

It was the best dinner we could have gotten anywhere. Everything we bought was heavenly good. We went back the next morning and bought more -- enough to carry home in a cooler.
The brownies have to be Ruth Reichl's Art Park brownie recipe. They taste just like them.

These empanadas are so! good! We shared the carne, pollo, serrano, and an apple one with ricotta cheese. All were so good and the carne was definitely our top choice; it was very reminiscent of empanadas you might find in Buenos Aires. The apple one was definitely a little heavy on the ricotta. I didn't mind that too much but it took my partner by surprise for a moment. The chimichurri was also real tasty! (Note that extra chimichurri also comes at an extra cost. Fully worth it.)

The in-store Renaud's has you covered...AND they have the everyday nasty stuff you crave: Lay's potato chips, Coke Zero, Kraft mac 'n Cheese, etc. If the watchful manager sees any checkout line more than a couple people long, another opens.

The Pacific Palisades remains the best in my view (much better than Century City or Marina Del Rey). There's one in SD now too, but it's sorta where SB Gelson's was a decade or so ago. 

The bakery is really tremendous (Renaud's I think, complete with terrific lower calorie ganaches). 

The deli case has things Bristol and Lazy don't. It's not better or worse, just different.

With small patio space in the front and a larger, more serene back patio, there are plenty of space to social distance and enjoy some good empanadas during this covid ordeal. 

My husband and I were actually on search for some good tacos and found Buena Onda as we walked by. Pictures looked good online and it also helps that we can conveniently also procure some donuts for after our light lunch. We decided to just try two empanadas, which was hard to pick between their many choices! We ended up setting with carne (beef), and manzanitas (apple with goat cheese). Our other option would have been the prosciutto, as it's quite unique too. 

We got our warm and toasty empanadas and headed for the back patio. The carne one came with a chimichurri-like sauce, which added a bit of moisture back to the empanadas. Nothing much to comment on and it was a delicious one. 

Now onto what in my opinion, is a show stopper. The manzanita empanada can be described as an enclosed apple pie, with goat cheese. Sounds like a weird combination, but the savory and pungent flavor from the goat cheese perfectly balanced out the sweetness from the apple sauce. The sauce was not too wet either, thus keeping the empanada still flaky and dry. Ugh the flavor was just so rich, so amazing! Literally, the only thing I could have wish for is the apple sauce and the goat cheese to be spread more evenly (side by side rather than top and bottom inside the empanada), so I can get a better combination of the flavors each bite I take. 

As I'm typing this up, I regret not taking any pictures. But honestly, the pictures of an empanada can't do justice of the content inside. Price point is not expensive either so you've just got to try a few for yourself! Wish to be back!",2020-09-10 04:49:01

The chicken Parm was good I just mixed it in with pasta at home. The quiche kinda tasted a little strong- couldn't place my finger on it, but something tasted a little strong (and it wasn't artichoke/spinach/egg).

The reason for the 1 star off was the server scooped lemon artichoke salad into a cup, but it fell off to the side. I saw it fall off on the side and the server tried to sneak it into my container. She didn't even clean the shelf. That was a fave dish, but I didn't take it bc it fell off to the side and I don't know what else to say. If food fell off the pan or onto the table would you expect a serve to still put it back on your plate and expect you to eat it?

Pros:
Salad bar- The Gelson's salad bar is lovely, clean and well maintained. I get lunch here all the time and I love their cilantro salad dressing.  I also appreciate that they have  strawberries, blue cheese and quinoa.
Bread- The bread at Gelson's is baked fresh whenever they run out  and it is very good considering it is a supermarket.
Service- The staff are very helpful and cheerful all the time, even when they are busy they will take time to help you out.

Cons-
Price- Because price is a factor for me I have to bring this up. Shoppers these days are savvy and Gelson's is not always the best value.
The Coffee/ Bakery Counter- This is like the black-hole of Gelson's, although I think it is not actually part of Gelson's officially.

*Parking is easy. 
*Covid (writing this 12/19/20) is taken very seriously, with carts sanitized and line etiquette strictly observed, inside and out.
*Always fun to try new things. I love the organic tortilla section and the terrific selection of kombucha. Great place to buy chips, too------SO much variety.
*The produce is unfailingly good. Some things are out of my price range (only organic will do for me), but whenever I get bananas, apples, other fruit, lettuce, kale, broccolini------it's always super fresh and tasty, high quality produce.
*Occasionally there's a free tasting of local wines and such. I'm not a drinker, but it's still fun every great once in a while to try fine wines/tequila.
*The cashiers are THE BEST. Five Star Staff all the way.  In my many years of shopping at Gelson's I only ever came across one semi-surly cashier. ""She won't be here long,"" I thought to myself. Never saw her there again. Gelson's appears to pride itself on happy, friendly employees.  Truly great people.
*You can sometimes find things at Gelson's that you can't find anywhere else.  I love to browse the ice cream freezer, just to see what's new.
*Best Part Is: The store got some new plastic carts-----I always hated bumping along on those tiles, with my metal cart banging away.  Too noisy. The new carts are much quieter and glide like limo-quality shopping carts.",2020-12-20 06:59:26

It was a bit hard to find out information about them, but they have all of their info up on their Google page (I uploaded the menu that they posted over here).

The woman who took my order over the phone was very nice, and everything was very easy to order.  She gave me detailed instructions on where the restaurant is since you have to go to the back of La Cumbre Plaza (the parking lot on Hope close to the south side of the plaza).  Curbside pickup went really well, and everyone wore masks to deliver the food.  The people who work here seem really nice.

The food was pretty good!  I personally ordered the chicken shawarma tacos, shawarma bread, baba ganouj, baklava, kunafeh, and basbosa.  They were all very flavorful.  The chicken shawarma is well-seasoned and flavorful, although somewhat different than what I was expecting.  The baba ganouj was excellent, and they included homemade pita chips to go with it.  The shawarma bread was nice, and I liked the dough a lot.  The three desserts (baklava, kunafeh, basbosa) were all very tasty.  Some french fries came with the tacos, but they were really undercooked and didn't seem to be fried.  Also, I should mention that everything was really thoughtfully packaged and survived the 15-ish minute trip back to Goleta.

Overall, I think this is a great start for a restaurant that has a lot of potential.  I think that Mr B fills an important gap in the Middle Eastern food scene in Santa Barbara, a city that has many restaurants but only a couple of Middle Eastern restaurants.  I'm looking forward to ordering from them again in the future (I'm eyeing the Moroccan breakfast for next time).",2021-10-09 19:21:56

I initially planned on preordering from the other location so was familiar with the price.  This location also doesn't have the Yelp check-in offer (one free empanada with purchase of half dozen).  It does offer a small discount for half dozen and dozen, but the price still ends up being higher than the other location.  I just ended up purchasing from this location because I was already getting donuts from Hook and Press Donuts, which is right next to this place.

Despite the price discrepancy between the two locations, I still think this place deserves five stars for its quality and taste.  I don't have too many other places to compare against, but these are the best ones I ever had.  I never really had a good one, which is why I generally don't order empanadas from any place.  I don't even care for the ones at Porto's.  

My family and I got two orders each of chicken, beef, and corn.  They were all excellent so I can't really pick a favorite.  The pastry shell wasn't too thick so you can really taste the filling, and wasn't oily.  I'm guessing these are baked instead of fried.  This place also uses good ingredients, like grass-fed ground beef and free-range Mary's chicken.  You will most likely need to eat two or three these to be full though.

Empanadas came with some dipping sauce but not sure what it was.  Seemed like olive oil with cilantro or something like that.  It was too oily so I didn't even use it.  Empanadas tasted good on their own so didn't think it was even necessary.

The owner explained that this was a middle eastern style shawarma, as opposed to a Persian one, which they make fresh everyday in house with imported Jordanian spices. Highly recommend - we devoured them.

The owner also brought us a complimentary dessert - basbosa. It was a warm square cake like pastry with almonds on top. It tasted of honey and coconut(?), and was delicious! Great service, great food. The owner is clearly passionate & the food seems to be very authentic.

So, if you come during busy time, you might need to wait a bit for tables to free up.  However, it looked like a lot of people were taking pastries and coffee to go.

We decided to try a fried egg sandwich with side of potatoes and a ham and egg  croissant sandwich with side of fruits.  Both sandwiches were very good and we were pleased with them.  I also bought an almond croissant and a chocolate croissant to take with us and they were excellent!  I would have to say it is one of the best almond croissants that I ever had!

It's so crunchy and flaky. It's so buttery. I love the almond taste, and it's not too sweet. I ate the entire thing in under 2 minutes and I wanted more. How could it be so delicious??? Probably because it's made with an entire stick of butter. 

They have tiny brioche muffins, plain croissants, fruit pastries, chocolates, and macarons. There's a few tables for a sit down hot meal, ideal spot to check into on a weekend morning.

As we were walking out the owner and another gentleman behind the bar cheered for us to stay. What surprised me was so did the customers at the bar, they were as friendly as the owner. Two of the customers made room for us and we began our wine tasting. As far  as I'm concern the people working behind the bar is what makes the wine tasting experience a good one or a bad one. Put it this way, we were going to sit there for a few minutes, instead we stayed there for four hours. They also made our grandma the center of attention and made her night.

That makes absolutely NO SENSE.
It's not possible - and has officially convinced me that Yelp has made a mistake in it's ratings and averages equations.

Renaud's, is something out of this world.
First of all - BELIEVE all the unbelievable little hype about the Macaroon's you keep reading/hearing about. It's very true - because I went from non-believer, to converting all my faithless friends to the glory of the Macaroon's.

Start here: Salted Caramel Macaroon. It makes me hurt to reminisce on how just this morning I was there devouring one of these. This is a BEST SELLER, and runs out fast. Next is the Passionfruit - the 2nd best seller there, which is great too.

OK so we can move forward: the REST of the beautiful pastries. They are really something to see if you just want to window-food-shop. The artistry, makes it hard to believe it's something you can ACTUALLY consume. 

I haven't been here for a meal yet - but I can tell you, the dishes look OUTSTANDING! There's some sandwich with an over easy egg that at minimum, 5 people are all eating at the various tables. It has to be delicious because every time I go, people never fail to have it when i'm looking around.

It's definitely a fun spot to grab a cup of java with a buddy.  They even have a little coffee bar when you can serve yourself different brews.  I didn't indulge, but my friends and I overheard another customer complain that most of the self-serve coffee was out at the time.

Although the menu online says they have a macchiato, the baristas claimed that they did not make such a beverage.  They suggested if we wanted something similar to a Starbucks caramel macchiato, our best bet was to get a caramel latte.  I didn't bother wasting time arguing with them, but anybody who knows even a little about coffee knows that lattes and macchiatos are completely different in composition.  So, I opted for the non-fat white chocolate latte instead in the hopes that I would receive a similar caffeine and sugar burst.  The latte was alright, but it wasn't anything I would write home about.  It was a little bitter for my taste, but I tolerated it because I really needed the energy jolt to start my day.

I wish I would have gone the same route as my friend who got the chai chiller.  This gem was an ice blended chai tea latte; it was just the right amount of sweet and spicy!

RoCo, as it apparently calls itself, is the earliest opening local in SB and as a morning person, I give it points for that.  I never understood a coffee place opening at 7AM.  I'm way past my need for joe by then.

I arrived right at opening time (5:30) and the two young ladies working the counter were fairly sleepy looking but were pleasant enough and handed me my cup and pointed me toward the self serve station.

I tried the State Street Blend.  They describe it as ""double french"" roasted.  In other words, DARK.  Most coffee snobs, which I can be occasionally, would call it burned.  It probably was, but I loved it anyway.  Just the thing to wake me up and inspire a 5 or 6  mile walk down State when no one is out except the homeless.

The interior of the shop is beautiful and probably is the best thing about RoCo.  It's just a very pleasant place to sit and enjoy coffee.

macarons(the correct french spelling btw). The place was totally
packed and full of good vibes. The staff was super friendly and
all looked busy but cheerful, like a dinner time In and Out. I 
recommend trying one of each flavor of macaron, they were all
aesthetically and masticabley pleasing, even the vanilla. I
don't know if traditional macarons are meant to be chewy
I think, because these are kept chilled or maybe its the
sugar soaking into the cookie section. Anyway, we still
enjoyed all of them, and I want to try all of other  
desserts. 

If you just want good macarons though, check out the check treats
at Cafe Luck sometime, way better.",2011-05-01 00:19:51

We came here for a light breakfast to munch on while wandering around Santa Barbara, cuz I love me pastries and as soon as I saw the word 'patisserie' in their name, I was hooked. The SO got their almond croissant and I the chocolate. Their layers are a bit thicker than the average croissant, but then you can really tell that they make it in house completely from scratch. I also liked that you can literally peel each layer to eat, which I liked doing cuz I'm strange. It was oddly fun, and I felt that I could taste the texture of the dough itself better and it had a lovely bite/chew texture, a bit more gluten formation than your typical croissant I think, or it may just be because it's a thicker layer. Either way, they are lovely.

It's a really tiny shop and ordering is like Corner Bakery style. We walked in around 10 am and it was crowded, line out the door. Thankfully we didn't want to sit and eat since we wanted to walk around the town instead.

The tasting fee was very reasonable and we got to a taste a few others that were ""off menu"". I love when wineries share more than what's standard. :)

The owner here is quite eclectic, chillax and looks like an all-around bad ass to be honest. He has good rock music blasting throughout the place and it seems like they possibly even have bands playing here since there was a killer stage inside.

The best advice I can give to someone tasting in Solvang is to save Sevtap for when you have plenty of time.  Time to enjoy fantastic varietals and time to chat with the owner.  He so clearly cares about his craft, and you can taste the difference in every sip.  Seriously, pencil this room in to your visit.  Plan to stay for a glass (at least) and be treated like family.

My personal favorite right now is the sav blanc.  It tastes very ""caramely"".  I'm not even a white drinker!!!!  Reds are available a plenty, My Love, the cab sav is equally delicious!!!  You just have to try them all, nothing like this anywhere else in this town.  Enjoy!!!",2016-09-20 03:14:09

Sadly I don't get the chance to come down here much anymore!  I'm living in SYV and don't make it down to the SB area very much anymore.  RoCo has completely spoiled me in terms of coffee....it is very rare for me to be able to enjoy a cup of coffee from a cafe as much as the coffee from RoCo. 

Thankfully I can hit up their website and have their ground coffee shipped out to me!  Of course it never tastes quite the same without the people and atmosphere of the location itself, but at least I can enjoy a cup of coffee instead of drinking swill for the caffeine boost alone.  :)",2009-06-15 21:48:57

The macarons were bland and tasteles, the brioche was nothing to write home about, furthermore the girl that served us was just plain rude, like she wanted us out of the place as soon as possible.

I was very skeptical but the bf and I stopped by here yesterday to grab some treats for a friend's birthday. We sampled some macarons..They are absolutely HEAVENLY delicate and melt in your mouth. I think I found a local-ish place to get my macaron fix now!
The popular almond croissant was golden brown, buttery, flaky, stuffed with almond cream and frankly, I don't think I have ever tasted almond croissants as good as Renaud's.

The cherry on top was the gentlemen who was very professional. I'm sad that I didn't even get his name ):  He even put a bow around my friend's box of treats. It's people like him that make my day. Thank you.",2013-02-27 17:49:25

This place has great coffee.  They roast their own beans, and when they're roasting the smells coming from this place bring me so much pleasure they should be illegal.  They say that the components in fresh coffee as well as chocolate cause a reaction in the brain similar to having sex.  I don't know who ""they"" are but I sure would love to have been on their research team!

This is one of the few places I know that can get good fresh roasted Costa Rican beans and I still will stop here frequently on my driving trips between L.A. and San Francisco.  Please don't go for the dark roasted beans if you're buying Costa Rican coffee!  This coffee has a light, fragrant, sublime flavor that reminds me of sweet tropical flowers after a summer rain and tastes almost exactly as it smells unlike most coffees.  A light to medium roast brings out the flavors the best, while the dark roast overpowers the delicate notes this coffee exhibits.  This coffee also has the highest caffeine content of any other coffee by far, and the darker you roast a coffee the more caffeine is destroyed in the process.

They have many other coffees here besides Costa Rican, but let me just say that they have an expert roaster and whatever your poison, they will bring out the best in it.

Price: This is a great tasting spot as a full tasting only sets you back $15 however I feel the wines (if you wanted to purchase them) were a bit on the pricey end than they needed to be (but hey that's a personal opinion after all I was born and raised in Napa Valley) Bottles start at $25 and go as high as $57 (I get it, good wine cost money however I felt this wine was more of an everyday wine than a wine you bust out for a special occasion so could have been priced a bit lower but hey it was still good) Total score: 4/5

Favorites:  The Jet'aime Jet'Adore Malbec was grand.",2015-11-23 19:32:19

The macarons were very nicely displayed and so we bought about a dozen of them in a prepared box. The prices for each was standard, but the flavors were very unique! The texture of the shells were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside while the fillings were just the right, not too sweet or bland. They were really delicious!

Very cool atmosphere if you are one of those people that likes to go hang out at a coffee place. I like that they roast the beans right there - you can see the roasting machine. I tried one of the flavored drop coffees and it was delicious. Not everyone likes those but I do and I thought theirs was very good. My husband had the mocha and it was top notch!

Pistachio, raspberry and salted caramel. The macarons were all decent, but again, they don't beat my favorite ones from Paulettes (Lettes) in Bev Hills. The jelly square thing was very good- i prefered these over the macs.

The chocolate croissant was also excellent. It was incredibly flaky and delicious. I which it was double the size. It seems small but still I'd order it again.

To our surprise, Mr. Renaud has figured out a way to thrive here, even opening 2 other locations and establishing a relationship with Gelson's. But he has done so by slowly adapting his offerings to suit the American palate: By reducing the variety of entremet-type desserts, increasing the 'Danish-like"" offerings that use the croissant dough, and (the reason I docked one star) drastically increasing the amount of sugar in his pastries. I find that I cannot eat most of them anymore. So Mr. Renaud, if you are reading this, please please don't abandon your original fans. Adapt most of your pastries to your clientele, but perhaps keep one or two of your offerings the way they are supposed to be (at the original level of sweetness) so that we can continue to support you.  If I may, I would like to request the return of the ""Nutella"" entremet. The closest thing to it that you have now is ""The Bomb"" but it's still not nearly as good as the Nutella (which would be even better if it was a tad less sweet). And we'd love to see the return of the traditional rolled Buches de Noel, instead of the molded ones. Please?

If it's well-known which ones of your pastries stay true to the European taste, your original fans would come back for them more regularly, I promise. And you might even pick up a few fans among the ""lower-carb"" crowd.",2016-10-04 17:19:54

The food scene in Santa Barbara is pretty weak. If I lived there, I'd come here all the time for breakfast and lunch -- it's healthy (many other women ordered salads) and delicious. If only Renaud's had a location in the LA area... Le sigh.",2013-03-27 21:32:10

I got one of each of the( 6) macaroons and 2 SALTED CARAMELS (my favorite candy!). The nice counter girl asked me if I'd had their macaroons before, and I lied and said yes. I'm not sure why I lied about this. She asked which one was my favorite. It was such a cute, sincere question expressing her love of sugar (like my own) that I instantly felt even WORSE about my apparent pathological-liar-ness, and said OOH WHATS THE WHITE ONE THAT ONE'S MY FAVORITE. She laughed at me like I'm boring (and not just a pathological liar) and said it was vanilla. Her favorite is the salted caramel macaroon, which I only got one of, because I had to go and get the whole variety of them even though I know I don't like fruity macaroons or chocolate. If I had just told the truth and not been a pathological liar, she probably woudl have talked me into getting 6 salted caramel ones, or even 3 salted caramel ones and nothing else, saving me some money and calories. Here's the breakdown:
1. Salted caramel. THE. BEST.
2. The other light brown one. Hazelnut? Coffee? Good.
3. Vanilla.
4/5/6. Chocolate, green and raspberry.

They were so good. I'm sorry I lied to you, helpful counter girl. When I totally have diabetes in 3 years I'll consider myself aptly punished =(",2010-11-30 22:01:43

I could not believe the vast selection of French pastries (not just croissants here!) and what's more, I couldn't believe how delicious every thing was! We ordered a few macaroons, one croissant, the mushroom quiche with the side salad, and the chocolate bomb as well as coffee.

The croissant was excellent and delicious heated up. Never have I had such a good croissant in the states. Flaky and a little crisp on the outside, and melt in your mouth soft and buttery on the inside. I originally split this with someone, but after one bite, we decided it would be prudent to have our own!

The chocolate macaroon was delicious, as well as the coffee. My friend said they don't compare to macaroons from France, but I'm usually not a macaroon fan, so that's saying something!

The coffee was very good as well, and the chocolate bomb was decently good. But the real treat, the jewel in the crown, was the mushroom quiche. Oh my goodness! I don't think I knew what quiches were before this one. It was so delicious and light, not heavy and oily. Whatever the blend of cheeses was, it worked wonders. Gooey and delicious and a perfect compliment to the soft and buttery eggs.

On top of that, all of the staff were friendly and attentive and the business itself is very cute and attractive.

All around, it was a lovely little meal, very well worth the price. Something you rarely find anymore. I will definitely be coming back. Thank you Renaud's for the wonderful experience!

They also had trivia night, which made for a very fun, competitive and social atmosphere.
The owner is very funny and upfront.

Most of the others ship it in from elsewhere, like Starbucks and Peet's.  RoCo kicks their butts, even with the foo-foo drinks (you know, the more milk than coffee, with tons of flavorings)!  The original location, where they roast, is in a little shopping center (State St and Guiterrez St) next to a Time Bike shop and an art gallery, with a great bakery (D'Angelo's) around the corner.  The coffee, people, atmosphere and charm of the original location can't be beat.  The Paseo Nuevo location serves great coffee, but lacks the space and charm, but what can you expect for being in the middle of an upscale shopping mall?  Besides coffee, espresso, and hot and cold coffee-based drinks, RoCo also serve a variety of pastries from a local bakery which are really good.  They offer free Wi-Fi Internet, which can be a little poky at time, but hey, it's free, so no complaints.  Honestly, the only place I've ever had better coffee than RoCo's is at Barefoot Roasters in Santa Clara.  But RoCo is more fun, funky, and has a way cool logo, so I still consider it my favorite coffee shop of all time.

All the walls inside are made of chalkboards so people write and leave messages, draw, etc. 

The wines are excellent, but the best part of our experience was chatting with Art the owner. He is friendly and knowledgeable about wines. We learned more about wines (and not his wines, but wines in general) from chatting with him and tasting wines than any tour, or any tasting we'd been to. Art was able to suggest tours, vineyards to visit, places to eat, etc. We did a lot of wine tastings in Solvang, and this was one of the few places where we bought some wine to take home. 

There are coupons (groupons) for Sevtap around town. Check this place out. They had said they were hoping to add a cheese shop, and as soon as they do we'll be back. We tired over 10 places in Solvang and this was one of the places that landed in our top 3.",2012-04-17 20:43:11

renauds is the closest in all of socal when it comes to macarons. we weren't expecting much and we decided after lunch at SB shelfish co. that after renauds we were going to mcconnells. we still did go to get ice cream and if they weren't closed the last time we went to SB we would have never gone because i could've eaten 10 of renauds pistachio macarons and maybe 5 of the vanilla on my own. on the drive home i thought too bad we live 3hrs away, but then i thought about it some more and actually it's a good thing.",2011-08-09 22:15:04

The couple are musicians so they ended up singing and playing the guitar for us after they had a drink. 

 One of the highlights of this place is that you are able to leave a piece of you behind by chalk.

The real value of the tasting is the owner himself, who is just downright fun to hang out with. Not only will he tell you about the wines, but you can chat about his personal life and how he got into winemaking. He's super nice and super entertaining, and everyone there is simply enjoying the chill atmosphere. Plus the wines were pretty great and affordable. We picked up a couple of bottles before leaving.

There are a lot of other things we didn't take advantage of, like trivia night or the live music, but I definitely would want to in the future. You can also buy the wines on the web site (or join his club), but there really isn't any pressure.

The almond croissant we simply devoured, incredibly good! The eggs were a perfect soft scramble, potatoes had an elegantly simple herb and garlic mixture which was not too strong on the garlic. Chicken sausage had an excellent herb blend and well cooked, not mushy or stiff. The baguette, which was already wonderful, came with a blueberry jam. My wife is not a fan of blueberry or jam, and she thought it was heavenly!

Finest ham and cheese croissant I have ever had! Egg was a perfect scramble across the entire croissant matching with the edges, as did the ham and gruyere. Not normally a fan of this cheese, but it was used sparingly, just the right amount. Croissant was crispy, flaky, buttery, and simply wonderful to the taste buds.

I studied pastry in Europe and this place brought back great memories!

Upon arriving, there was a line snaking out the front door...which is always a good sign in my opinion! While waiting, you have a chance to look over the menu. I chose the Renaud's Breakfast, where you can choose any pastry, paired with fresh fruit, and a cup of Peet's Coffee. 

I had the Almond Croissant. It's stuffed with almond filling and topped with toasted slivered almonds to give it that extra nutty flavor. Its drizzled with a light sugar glaze on top, to mellow out the buttery-ness and adding just the right amount of sweetness. Even the fresh fruit was delicious. Full of sweet cantaloupe  juicy pineapple, and plump grapes, it was the perfect healthy contrast to lighten up the buttery pastry.

So much so, we went back twice on the same day and we even closed the place down that  night. Unlike other tasting rooms in the area, the place feels more like a neighborhood pub which I appreciated it very much. The room is covered with chalkboards where patrons are encouraged to leave messages or create masterpieces on the walls. You could even write on some of the wood tables provided. The owner and winemaker Ertugrul is a real cool guy and makes you feel welcomed in his place. If you're lucky, he might play some air guitar for you...lol. But don't let his laid back attitude fool you. Ertugrul is a really good winemaker and his talents show in his great selections of wine. When you are there, sample the Serendipity (crispy and Oakey), Nesrin (real nice full body flavor), and Red Back (great tastes of peach and apricot) wines. They are all delicious.

By the time we finished dinner it was nearing 7:00 p.m. and we knew Sevtap was open til 8, (our hotel provided us with a coupon!) so we went in and gave it a try. 

One of the neat things about Solvang is that each winery has its own personality.  Some are sleek and trendy, some traditional, some more like a bar.  Each bring their own particular flavour to the wine-tasting experience.

Sevtap is the dive bar of wineries, and I say this in the most positive light possible.  It had the feel of a place you could go and just hang out.  The owner (dang it I forget his name!) was super sociable, filling everybody's glass with a smile and a story of how that particular selection got its name.  

The atmosphere rocked!  The walls are a giant chalkboard, and patrons decorated it with all kinds of fun graffiti. There was very cool artwork on the walls, and grunge music playing on the sound system.  They have live music sometimes, but not the night we went.

Oh, and the wine was really quite good.  I like sweeter wines, so the Nesrin was my wine of choice for the night.  My wife, however liked the Summer Love so much she bought a bottle.  (We RARELY buy a bottle at a wine tasting.)

Location/Setting: 

I give it an A+ for it's fine placement amongst other fun and hip locally owned storefronts on the final block of Chapala. It's a great place to walk around with friends or family and enjoy some window shopping for part of the day. Once inside it feels like you've entered into a world where friendliness and warmth is the new normal. It's a pretty big area that's a great place to go if you're looking to get some studying done, catch up with a friend, or just brighten up your day. They have an abundance of 75 minute street parking that turns to free after 6pm.

Food/Beverage:

I am pleasantly surprised to say that I think my vanilla latte here was actually better than both Handlebar and French Press. Very tough choice for me but I think I was really won over by the delicious layer of perfectly crafted foam that rested atop my delicious latte. The presentation isn't as appealing to me as Handlebar or French Press but based on flavor I would have to say it takes the cake. 

As far as their food items go they had a good selection to offer but I stuck with a plain toasted bagel and cream cheese. I was a little taken back when I was handed a cold bagel and small container of cream cheese and told that the toaster was in the corner. I quickly realized that this was nothing to be annoyed about and that it only added to the experience, plus, the bagel was pretty good! I can't wait to try more!

Our first stop to Santa Barbara Roasting Company, I asked about all the variety of tea selections they had (because on the menu on the shop there were only a few selections, but I noticed large pre-made tea containers behind the counter and asked out them). I ordered the mango iced tea,which they had ready to pour and was quite delicious. My husband ordered a shot of espresso to drink at the coffee shop and it came in a cute little porcelain cup --very adorable touch. 

The second trip to Santa Barbara Roasting Company, my husband ordered a regular cup of coffee, which was really neat because there were 6 different coffee blends to choose from. He had their signature blend, which he thought was a little more tart than he normally likes, but then again, we are used to generic Starbucks coffee. I ordered the 16 oz blended caramel cream with almond milk (they had almond and soy, which was a nice surprise). This drink was so delicious; however, it only lasted about 10 minutes before I drank it all...

Along with the yummy coffee, there is a friendly and fast-paced atmosphere that makes you feel like you are a local. Many customers came in knowing exactly what they wanted and while we stood there reading over their menu, we never once felt judged for not being a local. Whereas at the Starbucks in town, my husband and I had someone cut us off in line and the lady at the register didn't do a thing about it.

We did not buy any wines since the ones we liked seemed a bit pricey, but was enjoyable none-the-less.

I wish I could name one wine that was my favorite, but honestly I can't. They are all outstanding. I could just swish and smell them all for hours, that's how good they are -before you even taste them! 

We were so impressed by his blends and asking about his next batch of varieties for 2014 (which will include a Malbec and a Sangiovese) that he invited us to this warehouse the next day for a barrel tasting! It was amazing!!!

It's my last name"" LOL  He is very straight forward so if you can't handle that maybe this isnt your spot. The wine itself honestly blew us away. We loved all of them and we are pretty picky with wine, especially red wine.we love that all his wines have a story behind the name and we could taste the favors that were in it.

The shop is quaint, and more comfortable than any of the plentiful chains on State St. (Starbucks, Seattle's Best, etc.). I like the interior brick work, and the industrial roaster in the back. This really is the factory at work, but with enough seating and space to get things done on their free wi-fi. The music choice is excellent, a great mix of cafe-esque new age, classic, jazz, rock, and great oldies.

I recommend their ""seasonal"" white-chocolate roasted marsh-mellow cappuccino. I'm usually not one for the flavored drinks; mostly due to bad experiences at places like Starbucks or McDonald's where they use the motto ""the more pumps of artificial syrup the better"".

Huuuuh? I had no idea! Ok, I think I did have an idea that this little shop was also a taqueria, but it was the slightest little sliver of a memory from high school which was a long time ago, like uncountable layers of paint on the cow long ago.

I came to the little shopping center that la Tapatia is in for other reasons, but one member of my party declared she was going to grab some pan dulce and we all pushed into the tiny little bakery where the vivid cornucopia of savory menu items were displayed 8x10 color glossy glory along the wall.  I should say that they weren't *good* photos, someone commented that it looked like they were shot from a moving car, but it was enough to get the idea of coming back planted in our heads.

It was nearly 7 at night, not heaving with people, but the small handful of dining patrons were undoubtedly thinking ""crap, the gringos have found us. At least it's not Julia."" 

One wall is shelves of pan dulce, all sorts including my favorite, the butterfly curly thingie. We selected about half a dozen assorted, 75c each. That's all we got this time, but I looked long and hard that the food menu and asked questions. I would totally be back to sample the tacos. I'm on a taqueria tour, after all.

Meanwhile, the pastries. I couldn't dive into them until the following morning but my god they were so delicious. Really, the best butteryfly thingie I've ever had at a panaderia! Lightly crisp, yet dense and a little chewy. Did not fall apart in a big crumbly mess with each bite!
I sampled an assortment, and my meager handful of all the pan dulce available were all great. A great balance of fluffiness, denseness, a subtle sweet to the pastries. They'd be awesome to have with a sweet coffee. I know I'm not the only person brainwashed by mass produced grocery store sugar bomb cakes that has taken a bite of a gorgeous looking pan dulce and wondered where the hell the sweet was.  First, pastries need not be sugar bombs to be good, I finally figured that out. Second, these pan dulce weren't bland, they're Goldilock's ""just right"" middle ground and before I knew it, I'd eaten the whole thing up.

I went back two days later for lunch. Two of us ordered a small carnitas taco and the mole con pollo to share. 
The taco does indeed come with a freshly made tortilla. It's soft and chewy and holds up to the filling that only one tortilla is necessary, and provided. The taco is simple and good, served with cilantro and onion, with wedge of lime and a green salsa on the side. 

The winning item, though, was the mole con pollo. Whooooa, really good! It may have beat the top spot in my heart for chicken mole. The sauce was sweet and spicy, rich, complex. The chicken was perfect - one large thigh with such tender meat falling off the bone that you only need to pull it apart with pieces of tortilla. And the tortillas! The dish came with more fresh, soft tortillas, the largest I'd ever seen for homemade corn tortillas. This dish also comes with a small portion of rice and beans. 

Some notes:

* seriously hole in the wall. But they've packed a lot of stuff in.

* Small tables have been pushed together to make longer communal tables. If it's busy you can share the benches running along one of the walls.

* cash only

* no prices listed on the hot foods. Gotta ask. The chicken mole was probably in the $8 range. The small tacos were in the $2.50 range, larger ones in the $3.50 range. Seems high, you might think, but it's because they make their tortillas fresh to order. Which brings me to my last point.

* tortillas made fresh to order!

I've uploaded photos, but like any food using dark sauces, it doesn't look that good. In words of IT Crowd, ""It's chocolate! It's not shit.""",2010-09-19 14:57:40

The owner was a complete joy. We had him almost entirely to ourselves, as it was a bit slow, but it was one of our most memorable wine tastes of the weekend. ( 6 in total )

Not typical for the area, this wasn't just peppery Pinot after Pinot. We brought home 2 bottles of late harvest viognier ""Ayla"" because I really like dessert wines. The BF had a glass of the Zig-a-Zig-Ahh (cab) and he enjoyed it. I did the tasting.  Because we have a decent cellar at home,  he was picky on purchasing reds, but we were low on desserts. Yay for me.

From awesome, fresh roasted coffee to yummy pastries, you will not be sorry you came in.  The atmosphere is industrial with a nice touch of wood.  The wifi works and the baristas are edgy and fun to chat with. 

My favorites include the Rincon Red blend. A deep, dark roast with a very cocoa like after taste across the tongue.  For pastries, the cinnamon rose is a must have.  Think of a cinnamon roll meets crossaint and then baked in a muffin pan so the top expands out like a rose.  This flaky pastry offers the crispness and moisture of a crossaint, but the flavor of a cinnamon roll.  You can't go wrong, just wait until you get to the bottom... there is a surprise waiting.

I am skeptical of those places because often the hype exceeds what is actually produced. I'm happy to say that is not the case for Renaud's!

A past coworker and I were cursed with the same wicked sweet tooth and we would always buy and share little candies, baked goods etc. with each other. One Monday, she came over to my desk to ask me if I had been to Renaud's and had their Coconut Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookie. I had not but knew at that moment I must try it as our sweet teeth are very much aligned. Once I tried this cookie, I truly did wonder where it had been all of my life and ordered another. I have since been able to nearly replicate Renaud's recipe for this wonderful treat. Additionally, I have had the lovely experience of enjoying breakfast with at a couple different locations.

Finally, downtown dwellers are now in walking distance to the best croissants in town, because Renaud's has opened a new location in Arlington Plaza.

If you thought the uptown location was cramped, well, don't hold your breath. Or DO, because this one is even more ""bistro"" like. There's room for perhaps six 2-tops, scattered inside and outside the shop. So, really, consider it more of a shop rather than a restaurant, because the chances of you snagging a seat are slim.
Unless you're like me, who walked in on a late Sunday morning and no customers were there! But within 5 minutes, every table was full of hipsters and young professionals. 

And that's another equation to ponder:

Uptown location = old people
Downtown location = young people

My table's fancy was an almond croissant, a rum baba, a coffee and a fried egg sandwich. Yum, yum, yum, and....yum.  But I got lucky scoring a table before the deluge of customers piled in.

The vanilla and pistachio were pillowy and soft as a macaron should be, while the coffee and caramel were chewy and difficult to bite into, as if they had been sitting in the pastry case for days. 

For my meal, I got the croque madame sandwich, and it was very good. The light organic mixed greens salad that it was served next to complimented it well. The sandwich probably would've been better with more bechamel, but it was still great.

A lot of it has a deep, rich flavor that you don't always find in coffees.

I always like to go in when they're roasting the coffee because the aroma fills the shop and enhances the flavor of the coffee, in my opinion.  I also get coffee here to make at home since this is pretty much on the opposite side of town from me.",2019-03-09 00:41:37

The owner, setting & windmill it's inside of only makes it that much more appealing. We also learned that they have several types of events that take place there per night for entertainment, which makes it that much more fun to stick around to see what will happen.

Still not a bad perk, but just a side note since many reviews have pointed out the bogo and it was often what had me migrating there.

I'm a black coffee drinker so I can't say I have much input as far as lattes or cappuccinos go. Coffee comes in a plentiful assortment of roasts from light through dark and has always been fresh the handful of times I've gone. Lack of coffee knowledge doesn't bother me. As long as there is at least one person on staff that can answer my quirky coffee questions I'm satisfiedb considering it is a college town and it does seem like a great job for students. Although I don't disbelieve the poor customer service reviews, I can honestly say I have not come across an outright rude employee; maybe nervous, maybe shy, but never rude or standoffish.

As mentioned, bathroom code is on the receipt and tends to be pretty clean. Wi-Fi is accessible. Tons of space inside and outside.

My girlfriend ordered an iced mocha with some cinnamon added on request, while I ordered a blended cookies and cream, due to my intense love of sugary drinks that anger most coffee snobs.

My drink was surprisingly good, satisfying my sweet tooth and not as overpowering or heavy as I had feared it might be. My girlfriend, whose coffee standards are far more refined than mine, was quite pleased with hers as well. 

After splitting a lovely little banana bread muffin, you really can't find much to complain about - aside from those silly eco-friendly straws that inevitably turn into soggy paper as time passes.

I'm all for supporting little local coffee shops that serve up good drinks and offer a low-key place to hang out - without trying to go for that whole pretentious ""scenester"" vibe that far too many of them are guilty of embracing.

Sevtap has just changed their location and I was one of their first customers on their opening day at their new location (Location is now on Copenhagen Dr). 

We were three of us wine tasting and the owner was truly one of the reasons why the wine tasting was so great! The owner was a really neat guy and my family and I enjoyed chatting with him.

For the wine tasting there was 1 white & 6 reds to try. I usually only really drink whites, but enjoy trying reds to find one I like. I really enjoyed the white called ""precious"" (That was a given for me), but the thing that surprised me is how much I enjoyed most of the reds! That doesn't happen often. I really enjoyed the red called ""pillow talk"", it was really good! 

We ended up using the Yelp offer which was to buy three bottles and get a free wine tasting. We bought precious (a chardonnay), nola (a merlot) & pillow talk (a petit verdot). Excited to open one of these on Christmas as well as give one as a gift!

Before we left the owner told us we could be the first to leave a note on his chalkboard wall, which we of course did. Love the idea of him having a chalkboard wall for people to leave notes on about the place!

The Renaud's omelette breakfast with fruit and sourdough toast was delicious, and filling but not too heavy. The mixed berry jam was the star of the meal- applied to toast with butter it is a yummy breakfast dessert.
The cafe au lait I had was pretty good, although I think I would've preferred a lighter roast coffee. I still managed to choke it down though ;)

The walls are covered with chalkboard paint, so customers come in and draw and write all over them. It gives it a very fresh, unique, and fun vibe.

It might have just been the day we were in there, but the owner seemed to be a little cynical. We talked about wine a little bit, but also about life and other topics since no one else was in there. He seemed to be reluctant to talk too much about his wine. We were new to wine and trying to learn more about it, so he came off to us as a little bit of a wine snob.

steve h. and i were given quesadillas (the ""s"" at the end makes a difference and is not to be confused with a quesadilla- no ""s"") and something that looks like a tostada called a sopes? not sure if i spelled it correctly.  the bread / tortilla on both of these dishes were outstanding and like nothing i've had before!!

I'm happy to say the chicken flautas were amazing!! You couldn't get more authentic than how these were prepared. The chicken was well seasoned and not bland like most taquitos or flautas tend to be. BTW these are prepared with corn tortillas so they are pretty much taquitos in my opinion.

The bread is slathered with a half-inch layer of something - either butter or whipped cheese. It had the consistency and taste of butter.

It could have been 8 oz. of butter! Then, it's layered with BACON! One egg with onions on top, and then yellow, waxy, cheese melted over the entire dish.

Very cool, low-key tasting room with a wonderful welcoming feel and - here's the best part - some of the best wines we had tasted all weekend.  Near the Wine Valley Inn, on a quaint, quiet street, Sevtap doesn't need the foot traffic to make it.

All chalkboard walls, competed with bowls of chalk, so come with your creative spirit, and add to the art!  Just leave the naked woman alone....

And yes, we are now very happy members of the ""wine club for people who like good wine""  or something to that affect (that's the truth of it, anyhow).

We saw the Starbucks, but I wanted something local.  After searching Yelp, I was sold on this place because of the mention of vegan cinnamon rolls.  I got the vanilla one and it was delicious.  If I knew how good it would be I would have purchased the whole tray.

I also ordered an iced latte with soy and a triple espresso (because of the buy 1/get 1 deal). I was impressed by the quality of the espresso.  It was perfectly roasted and smooth, without a bitter taste.  I just had to add a touch of honey to the iced latte and it was perfect.  I saved the triple espresso for the next day and even after sitting a refrigerator overnight and being reheated in the microwave, it still tasted good.

But don't miss it! Out of all the places we've been to in Santa Barbara, Sevtap definitely makes it to the top of the list. Spanish tapas style restaurant that makes its own bread and wine! We started with the gazpacho, which was nicely balanced and refreshing. We also had the shrimp in tomato sauce, lamb, and grilled octopus. All three dishes were amazing. The shrimp dish was rich in sauce so it was a pleasure dipping Sevtap's divine fresh bread in it. We paired the food mainly with a bottle of their Albarino, which went amazingly well with the seafood tapas. We also tried a glass of the Step Monster, which you'll definitely love if you like big, bold wines. The best part of our experience at Sevtap was meeting and talking to Arturo or ""Art"", the owner, chef, and winemaker. We stayed until closing time and had a lengthy discussion with Art about his life, his career as a chef and before that, and lots and lots of other things. Art is such a nice guy with an amazing charisma and sense of humor. We were too full for dessert but we had Art's delicious stories sweeten the rest of our evening. On top of all that, he gave us two fresh loaves on the house to take with us.

As I was ready to ordered, I was greeted by one of the barista here. Ordered an hot mocha. I must say the mocha I got was pretty strong. Really like how strong it was, woke me up throughout the day during my day off from work. 

Service here was pretty good. Very nice baristas here. And it was fast too. Seating area was pretty decent, some college students hang out with their laptop to do some studying. And there's some outlets too if you want to charge your electronics.

For parking, it's 75 minutes free parking in the public parking lot, $1.50 for an each hour after that, and it's walking distance to the beach too. 

Overall, not too bad for an first try. Will come back here and update on this place. For now, 4 stars.

Perfectly spiced, if a tad too sweet, it made great fuel for an hour and a half of coworking with two friends on a Thursday afternoon. I was sure to ask for it in a ""for here"" porcelain cup and it came in a cute red vessel filled to the brim, thankfully paired with matching saucer. My friends didn't specify ""for here"" and were served their drinks in disposables, so if you want to make the eco-friendly choice, be sure to ask. 

We wish the shop stayed open later, and would have happily spent more time (and probably money) sipping drinks and working. The wifi is free and fast (just register with your email address) and there are seating options to suit your Covid-safety preferences, from the dog-friendly astroturf outdoor area to a couple of tables on the sidewalk to seating indoors along both walls. 

Exposed brickwork and high ceilings made for a nice vibe, service was friendly, and the restrooms are gender neutral. All wins. Restroom access codes are printed at the bottom of receipts, which is convenient for customers but isn't great overall--bathroom access is a big homeless rights issue. Also, there is a vegan tax (upcharging for plant-based milk), which doesn't make me happy--ethical and sustainable choices should be rewarded with positive reinforcement, and if plant milks didn't cost extra, perhaps more people would try them. 

Those downsides being what they are, my visit was overall pleasant and positive. Other things on the extensive coffee and tea menu caught my eye, chai being my go-to first-visit test-drink. I would come here again to sip and study, and aim to arrive earlier in the day.",2021-09-08 04:10:18

We too started off iffy with the owner but I can understand his viewpoint of dealing with tipsy people all day - some are going to be FUN and some are going to be NOT. I can't say it was a 5-star experience because my phone had his old Yelp offer and he blamed it on my smartphone not being smart (hey, if I can figure out how to be Yelp Elite for 7 years while using plenty of Yelp offers I don't think it's my phone....just sayin'). But the more we hung out with him we all turned into friends - so much so that we all signed up for the Sevtap Wine Club by the end of our visit AND he showed me that I really do love white wines - I just needed to find the right ones to fall in love with :-) 

The wines btw are great, in my opinion. I know everyone has different tastes. We started with 4 red wine flights and then he shared a few whites with us (which were stellar!!) so we went with 4 more white wine flights. And, he lets you pick your own wine for your wine club shipment!!! I've never experienced this luxury and that right there is awesome. I'm used to the winery shipping whatever willy, nilly wine they want. This is a nice touch.

Back to the wine! The reds had great names that he chose for touching personal reasons, which made them mean something to us as well. He even had one named after his dog, Leyla, and proceeds from every bottle purchase go to the local humane society where he adopted Leyla from! C'mon judgers, he's a good guy!

Honestly, the reds just kept tasting better and better - and very rich and unique. The whites, I have to say, were an extremely wonderful surprise! The Chenin Blanc, which I've never heard of before, was fantastic! My hubs fell in love with the Grenache Blanc - also unique and very delicious. 

All in all, we spent well over an hour at Sevtap and enjoyed our visit. The owner is entertaining, very knowledgeable and has a great sense of humor.

He didn't mind telling things how they were and just the way he spoke made you feel like this guy was genuine.

Make sure to pick up the empanadas as well, pumpkin filling or pineapple, even vanilla pudding. They are all delicious. Polvorones and the marranitos are my families favorites. 
If Pan Dulce is too sweet for you, La Tapatia also offers menudo and pozole on weekends, along with other delicious Mexican dishes which they serve on a daily basis.

When I last visited years ago, there was no covid and you could have free coffee up to an hour. Not sure this is still the case.

We stopped in Santa Barbara solely to get coffee. When we arrived, there are two kiosks outside to submit and pay for an order. You can also order inside from an employee. The set-up is order on one side, pick up on the other. It's convenient.

During covid, there are clear barriers up and people wearing masks. All customers had masks.

I was tired and had to drive, so ordered a double shot vanilla iced latte and my wife had iced tea. We liked everything. Prices are a bit higher because it's really good coffee. We didn't have any food.

It's really relaxing to sit at an outside table and enjoy coffee. Nice we can do it again.

People were passing by with tacos from the nearby place and saw a few women carrying yoga mats to a yoga class.

*REASON FOR 4 STARS AND NOT FIVE:

I wanted to give Renaud's 5 stars. However, when you place a delivery order on Doordash, Renaud's placed a check-box which one is meant to click below each of the menu items. It reads: ""$.25 To-Go-Container-Fee"" or something along those lines.

That is not good business. If someone is supporting your restaurant by placing a delivery/to-go order, it is disrespectful to the customer to request that they pay you a fealty for the privilege to buy their food.

It's bad business and it's not cool.

It's Friday and you've got extra tickets to a show but all of your friends bailed on you at the last minute.

You figure, ""What the hell."" She seems about your age. You go out on a limb and ask the librarian her name.

You give her your name and she cracks an awkward smile.

She laughs nervously as she pushes some hair away from her face and around her ear.

""Of course I do. How could someone not love music? It's one of life's greatest pleasures. Among other things...""

You nod in agreement. At that moment you recognize a radiance about her that you didn't see before. So formal, so put together. Now a warmth reveals itself.

A few hours later, you've found your way to Libby's porch and ring the doorbell. The door swings open to reveal a cardigan-clad Libby. Different colored cardigan and a new brooch.

""Sounds great. Mind if I use your restroom first?""

""Of course. It's just straight back in the bedroom.""

You enter. Pink walls, some dolls, lots of books. Figures. You crack open a door. Hanging inside are various latex and leather bodysuits, ropes, toys of unimaginable use.

""This is not the bathroom.""

Your night takes an unexpected turn.

Renaud's is perfectly quiet and cute on the outside but a freak in the sheets. It will make you want to do dirty things to those buttery treats. Don't worry, it will be your little secret... sinner.

Highly recommend the almond croissant, eggs, ham & cheese croissant, maybe a croissant or three?",2017-11-02 03:43:24

I have never had as deep, rich, profound, tasty cup as here. It's almost as if they can take everything wonderful about coffee, concentrate it, distill it and infuse it into a cup. 

First of all, it is nuclear hot, almost ungodly hot. I usually try to drink my coffee with as little milk and sugar as possible, but here, the milk and sugar (and lots of them) were a necessity. Or maybe I just wasn't ready to try it without the crutches of milk and sugar. Like my head might explode. As in ""you can't handle the truth"" or ""you aren't worthy"".

Located just slightly off the touristy beaten path of quaint old world architecture we found the unassuming winery tasting room.  It was early and our party of 4 were the only ones in the place.  It was a funky place with colored banners hanging from the ceiling and the chalkboard covered walls full of all sorts of art, provided by the various patrons who visited before us.

The proprietor was a fun guy sharing some colorful stories about his path from his native Turkey to some of the steps it took before he got in the wine business and ultimately started Sevtap Winery a few years ago.

His wines surprised us  a couple of different ways...first, there was not a Pinot Noir to be found - hmmm, isn't that what this entire region is known for?  Just watch the movie Sideways and you'd be convinced that's the only worthwhile wine in the region.  Well, I disagree, I believe the region has so much more to offer so I was very pleasantly surprised to find a tasting the focused more on big bold reds.

This is the second surprise I was treated to...not only were there not any Pinot Noirs but there was, what I consider to be a rare find - a nice Petit Verdot that he calls, ""Pillow Talk"".

I also enjoyed his Malbec which is another wine that I did not expect to find.  Along with his Cabernet_Franc and the Cabernet Sauvignon I was very pleasantly treated to some of the biggest and boldest reds of my trip so far.

My favorite croissant from Renaud's is the Almond Croissant, which comes with a delicious almond paste inside and sugared almonds encrusted on the top. They are very generous with the almonds and it provides an amazing crunchy and nutty contrast to the sweet, chewy, buttery, crisp and airy pastry. It goes down very easy with some straight black coffee. 

""Renaud's"" is definitely a magic word as an office treat and it will cause a little bit of low-key mayhem with people trying to beat each other to the break-room in a thinly veiled yet fierce competition for the almond croissants in the box.

Of course, his wines are outstanding (we particularly admired his syrah and sangiovese), but it's the sophisticated-yet-casual (and very fun) vibe that sets Sevtap apart from the other wine bars and tasting rooms we've visited in Solvang.

For instance, Sevtap offers world-class wines, attracts a hip, diverse range of guests...yet ""keeps it real"" by offering trivia, acoustic guitars on a stage that you can play, etc. (And thankfully, Sevtap does not allow KIDS--as described in another review--because man, when I'm knocking back glasses of wine, I want to be around ADULTS, not tourists' rambunctious children!)

After visiting for a tasting before dinner, we couldn't resist going back to enjoy the rest of the evening, and there's no doubt that this will be our main spot the next time we visit Solvang.",2014-04-23 18:48:07

Our tasting appointment felt like a fantastical Willy Wonka experience, and she let us try a bunch of cake and icing flavors separately and together in a mix n match way that felt more flexible and customized than other tastings we went to. We were conflicted on design, but her Instagram was helpful in looking at what she'd done in the past, and ultimately we sent her a few photos of what we liked and she brought it to life. We had two flavors: carrot cake with citrus cream cheese frosting, and mexican vanilla with cinnamon cream cheese frosting, with an all-over layer of vanilla cream cheese frosting.

Her prices are competitive to the common bakeries you can work with for wedding cakes, but her boutique like service makes you feel like you are the most important client she has. AND THE QUALITY!!!! What she created was unlike anything I had ever tasted, and we gave her a challenge (I'm sure everyone thinks that). Our request was for a four tier cake fashioned after individual layers from four different inspirations. Here's where it gets fun; one layer needed to be vegan chocolate, one carrot with a cream cheese filling, another layer being a ridiculous lemon with raspberry sauce, and the final being a crazy chocolate mousse like cake with a raspberry filler. What's not obvious in that selection is the varying degrees of density, AND following our choice of which layer was which. You will find that the quality of the cakes you taste in your sampling will carry over to the big day. Now I'm not suggesting you don't taste what other bakers have to offer, as free'ish cake is always good! But, if you don't have time you can confidently contract with Laurie and be amazed how her contribution to your special day will be the so called icing on the cake!

I also lucked out that our accent color was a rustic terracotta color which she ended up playing around with in several samples she designed and revealed on Instagram. I trusted her ability to take a picture as inspiration and bring it to life with all her unique marble design and aesthetics. The cake arrived on our wedding day truly exceeding our expectations.

She took the time to hold several calls with us and discuss our vision for dessert for the welcome party we were hosting in Santa Barbara.  We knew we wanted a dessert with both the kid's colleges represented but didn't know whether we wanted cake or cookies, but Lele was there to guide us. She was patient and knowledgeable and helped walk us through all the options and possibilities.  In the end, Lele's cookie design and packaging turned out perfect ... and even better than we had imagined! They couldn't have been more perfect, and we were so pleased!  The cookies were in clear bag with a ribbon tying their printed insignia onto it.  The presentation of the cookies looked great and were a big hit as they were wrapped so our guests could take them as they left the party.  Guests came up to us the next day at the wedding telling us they were the best tasting cookies they had ever eaten. 

We contacted Lele only a week before the welcome party which was incredible that she could pull this off on such short notice.  Working with Lele, we could tell that she was passionate about her job and dedicated to getting it right! Lele was professional, very flexible, easy to communicate and coordinate with, and sweet!  We highly recommend her!",2019-09-29 23:37:31

Because I, as a Boston native, should have known better than to order Maine lobster in Santa Barbara. I was probably too inspired by a recent NPR report about the summer lobster glut, and thought that the crustaceans were swimming to Central Coast shores due to overcrowding. In this case, the lobster probably flew frozen and pre-chopped, which explains the rubberized bits. (Increased surface area makes a delicate lobster more vulnerable to overcooking.) The Husband also complained his egg was overcooked (sadly, prob just by a few seconds, as the yolk should run thickly on a proper benedict, as mine did). 

Ok, that over, let's go to the good stuff: The accompanying potato hash looked like an assortment of sweet potato, yukon, and Peruvian and was damn good. We also ordered plain challah French toast, and that too came thick and flavorful, and sprinkled with blueberries. The coffee was Peet's, the water was flavored with strawberries and oranges, and the bakery case was fat with pastries that looked mighty good.

There's seating inside and outside (right next to the parked cars, so minimal ambience unless you really like SUVs), and overall the joint is small. One person snags a table or counter while the other orders at the register (this is what the waitress recommended, so therefore is not an impolite technique). The pricing was reasonable, turnover was very quick, and the single bathroom facility was clean.

Just don't expect a lobster to crawl on your lap and beg you to eat it.",2012-07-16 16:21:30

This small little neighborhood bakery/restaurant is simply amazing all the way around.

As you make your way in there is a super chipper and welcoming hostess at the door to hand you the menu and ask you where you would like to be seated. She informs you that you'll be ordering at the register and that your table will be ready for you when your done ordering.

When I came in I had asked if it was okay for me to bring my dog to sit out on the patio with me while I have my breakfast and she said yes. So without a doubt now you've been informed that this place is dog friendly.

I was happy to find out that my pooch could sit with me instead of in a hot car. After ordering I tied my pooch to the table and within less than 5 minutes my  healthy breakfast came out.

I ordered an egg white veggie scramble with sliced tomatoes and their homemade butter biscuit, which was simply delicious. Some of the dishes on the menu like the egg white scramble are a tad pricy, but worth if your having to watch what your eating.

I'm super glad that I found this place on Yelp and I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a breakfast place in this particular area. Jeannine's is by far my favorite breakfast place in Santa Barbara and I'm sure if your give it a try you'll love it too!

Atmosphere & Service- cute/casual.  There are about a dozen outdoor tables with an overhang and flowers, and maybe 6 tables inside.  You walk up to the counter to order but a hostess reserves a table for you, so there's no ""quick and the dead""  stress about rounding up a table.  Service is friendly and efficient, though not standout.  

Food- Now, I consider myself a bit of a benedict connoisseur and I do love the benedict here.  The sauce is more ordinary tasty but the ingredients are so fresh, and they have such great combos of flavors in each of the benedict options, that it is outstanding.  I have tried nearly all of their benedicts and my favorite is the Florentine.  It's not listed on the menu right now, but you can still ask for it:  avocado, sauteed spinach, and fresh tomato top the eggs and muffin.  It's great if you want a slightly lighter benedict.  It comes with a side of fruit.  And I don't mean, some grainy old fruit that's been marinating in it's own juices....I mean fresh, brightly colored, perfectly ripe fruit.

Positives: sweet atmosphere with lots of seating, a fire place & cool games. Great food - we had a steak sandwich that was killer, and the baked treats are tasty too. 

Negatives: while the coffee is good, it's just a 4/5 good. When you get lattes they can either be WOW the most aromatic espresso, perfectly steamed milk, and precise proportions of syrup and you'll be hooked and wanting to go back the next day. BUT.. it's the next day that can disappoint. You could have a completely different experience with a milky, watery tasting espresso and overly sweet, or not enough flavor - it's really the biggest contrast in coffee shops i've ever experienced. 
Another negative - the smoking workers right out back behind the door only feet from the register. It's... really gross. I am not one easily offended by smoking, but when they come take your order (sometimes you wait 5 - 10 mins by yourself in line waiting for them to come back in from their smoke breaks) and put out their butt, and then make your drink with no hand washing in between.. It's enough to make the most ungermaphob/undisturbed by smoking person squeamish. Big turn off, but to be honest, the owners don't really have better habits either. They can be rood, disinterested, rushing you, and not even engaging you while taking your order, and be conversing with other customers/workers.. A little rood, but sometimes it's better than the way you're forced into a convo like you are at Starbucks.

So I hope that when YOU go in, you get the killer fantastic drink, not the meh one, and  even if you do, PLEASE do come back, it is worth it. Try to not get too put off by the unsanitary/unsocial behaviors of the owners/workers - you have an immune system for the germs, and a cell phone to look at when it's awkward waiting for them to engage you, lol.",2012-11-08 19:15:34

I was advised that their Carrot Cake was the best in town.
Well, I concur. I first tried a piece from the counter cooler and it was just perfection.
So I ordered a whole Carrot Cake for a birthday party I was going to attend.
This stuff s just delightful and everyone who had some agreed. And that was everyone at the party.
The consensus was unanimous. The cake is moist and delicious but not too heavy. 
The Cream Cheese frosting is just right. Not too sweet and with a light Cream Cheese flavor.
Some might think it is a little pricey, but for the quality of the product you get, it is worth every penny.
My family and friends said they had never had Carrot Cake better than this.
And my nephew who doesn't really like Carrot Cake was raving at how good the cake was.
The staff at Jeannine's was very helpful even asking me how many people I was expecting so they could determine what size cake I would need.
I will be going back to try their other offerings soon and I will definitely be ordering the Carrot Cake again soon..",2013-11-18 16:29:10

Thankfully, it is not Denny's, nor would I expect that for SB. They have a person at the front that will assist you in getting a table which is great considering you order at the counter and need a place to sit with your latte (which are creative and tasty). The hot tip for this place is to get the amazing French toast with the maple syrup on the side. It can come drenched and no one loves drowning French toast. For your next office meeting, I suggest ordering the day before, the caramel walnut cinnamon roll at the cafe on State St along with other scones and baked goods. Those caramel walnut cinnamon rolls are to die for! They have a full service restaurant and the eggs are so light and fluffy. The proportions are also very nice.  I also love the quinoa and the fact the coffee bar is available with great tasting coffee is a plus. If you get the latte, they will fill your cup with great tasting coffee (for free) for you. The other plus about this restaurant, is that it is dog friendly and they have a water bowl available for your pet. For that reason, I give it 4 stars.",2014-09-29 17:09:23

The way that they serve food here is kind of strange, but I  like it. You wait in line to order, then while you are waiting, they give you a number for a table (you choose inside or out), then you order, and then you sit at your table and wait for them to bring you the food. The good thing is that you don't have to wait for them to bring you a bill after you are finished. You can just leave.

I couldn't pass up the chance to try it out while I was there the past weekend. All I can say is ""wait until you try the food if you think the décor is good."" 

This particular store is located at the La Arcada, a hidden gem of SB, on State Street. This store is well designed with a high ceiling. My friend and I were going to try the summer-berry or raspberry white cake. But since it was our first time there, we asked for the most popular cake. However, when the young lady, who works there, told us that the strawberry white cake is their most request one, I was skeptical about it. The cake looks like one of those wedding cakes; pretty to look at but offer neither flavor nor texture. We took her words and ordered one just to try out. All I can say is OMG. This is simply the BEST slice of cake that I have ever had. The proportion of the yellow cake and the cream were just perfect. The cream is quite tasty and the strawberries are not too sweet or sour. I don't normally eat the cream when I have cakes, but in this case I finish the entire piece. No one ingredient overpowering one another. Overall this is a great experience, and we will come back for their breakfast items next time we are in town.

Dishes: Kahlua Banana French Toast; Lobster Benedict

To be honest, we accidentally happened upon this one on our way to another eatery. The other eatery was too long of a wait when we got there. Since we noticed Jeannine's, we Yelped it. So glad we accidentally got here. The food is great. Their coffee is nice & strong.

-Kahlua Banana French Toast (5*). One of my top favorite French toasts. Awesome flavor. Love the caramelized bananas! Good enough to eat without syrup. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
-Lobster Benedict (4*). I'm not into Benedict as much as the wife, but this is a good one you shouldn't miss. Not sure if The lobster is fresh, but it sure tastes like it. Really good lobster flavor. Poached egg is great & the hollandaise sauce is pretty good. Good dish. Yes, she loved this dish.",2014-01-03 23:01:28

The selection for brunch was nice, from eggs to french toast. I ordered the lobster omelet - the special - and I was satisfied. Personally, I think that I like to eat lobster without the egg. My friends ordered other dishes like the french toast and all the dishes came out in a beautiful aesthetic. Then I had the strawberry white cake which was reallly yummy.

So many of the specials looked delicious, but I sunk my teeth into the Peach French Toast on challah bread, with a side of link sausage. Hands down, this was one of the best french toast experiences I've ever had. There was no need for syrup because the peaches and the liqueur they were soaked in provided just the right flavor and consistency.

We arrived at 9am and just barely beat the breakfast crowd.  It's counter service but if you're dining in, you are given a table number by the hostess and assigned a table. With our great timing, we were able to pick our table and scored a table for 4 right by the window which worked out great.

I ordered the eggs benedict which came with a side of fruit and I also ordered a side of potatoes. I needed extra carbs to soak up all the wine we drank the night before. = )

Service was fantastic even though it was counter service. Several staff members checked on us throughout the time we were dining to ensure we were ok and everything was to our liking. Of course, everything was. My girlfriend and I both had the eggs benedict and devoured them. So tasty and just a hint of spice so i'm guessing there's put a pinch of cayenne pepper in their hollandaise sauce.

We were seated right by the pastry case so during breakfast, I kept glancing over at them and eventually talked myself in to grabbing several to take home to the hubby. I chose the chocolate chip scone, maple scone and the cranberry scone.  When I brought them home, the hubby ate them all the following day for breakfast, lunch and dessert. He was too quick to eat them so I didn't get a chance to sample but he made a comment that I should've picked up more. I take it, they were good.

Yes. Its orgasm served on a plate for those that quench the sweetness of sugar.

Prompt service and helpful instructions (realized this place was a cafeteria-served setting) and her recommendation of the French Toast was a bulls-eye. Freshly baked bread along with their homemade maple syrup with butter toffee along with a few banana slices made this dish my favorite French toast of all time. Driving over 100 miles is well worth it.

For those who need choices:  You may select what kind of milk to add to your beverage including regular milk, half-n-half, soy milk, almond milk, and rice milk.

The menu looked incredible and my friend ordered one of their specialty omelettes ( corn, asparagus, spinach, and goat cheese) and I ordered the Greek frittata with egg whites.  Our food was incredible!!  The only factor holding back a 5 star review, was a very rude gentleman who was working there.  He practically berated our cashier for ringing up a split of champagne, which was on the menu, which apparently they didn't have anymore.  He was also very rude to us as well.  We tried to dismiss this to the fact that it was incredibly busy there, but he continued to be extremely abrupt and rude to us throughout our entire visit.  Based on the food, atmosphere, and other service (Brittany was awesome!), this place is worth 4 stars.  To those who are complaining about the price, from what we saw everything else on State Street is at the same price point.  Yes, pricey, but apparently this is what to expect in the area.",2012-04-16 03:31:14

I'm a mocha kind of guy and always interested in trying out a cup of mocha from different coffee shops. I decided to get their mint mocha with an extra shot of espresso (i have learned that extra shot of espresso does it for me because typically it is more on the ""chocolate"" side and I liked it more on the ""coffee"" taste). It came out just right. I found it funny but cute that the cute barista (an-yeong) made a mocha art design which typically does not happen for a mocha. They are usually done on cappuccino so I feel like extra time and dedication went into this cup of mocha. Good job! I saw some people order other things like a banana blueberry blended drink, avocado bread, and salad which looks very yummy. I think I will try that out next time! Overall experience was good. I saw a post about a single person working in the morning but that was not the case here probably because they expect a crowd (6pm) and have more people working.",2013-08-23 15:36:14

I've tried a few sandwiches, bagels and the avocado toast (which is really good when their tomatoes are ripe) but the prices are pretty steep. Still need to try the tri tip that everyone is raving about...

I've had almost all their caffeinated teas (no herbal for this gal) and my favorite is the ginger peach black tea. Is it peach? I think it's peach. It's some fruit. Anyway it's delicious. I like that they make their tea bags on the spot with loose leaf tea rather than the boxed teabags with the string and the staple. You know what i'm talking about...

The only issue I had last time was the lady who was helping me, though extremely friendly, was rubbing her eye like crazy. She keyed my order into the register, handled my cash, gave me my change. Then, without washing her hands, made my tea. It felt like she was filling the tea bag and rolling it shut in slow motion... My friend convinced me that the hot water from the tea killed the germs. I guess I don't care that much since my roommate's dog regularly licks my entire face and sometimes gets a whack at my teeth and he has been known to cleanse himself and eat poopies. At any rate, my tea was delicious. Maybe it was the eye juice and germs?

But before I get into the nit-picks, if you go there for anything but the various Benedict entrees you are a fool! :P  Absolutely best eggs Benedict in the world.

Now to the nit-picks.  If management is listening, you might consider changing a few minor things to bump this review (and future ones too) up to 5 stars!

First, if you have more than 4 people attending make sure to avoid this location.  4 is the very most you can fit in the tables (inside or out).  I haven't been to the downtown location, but this one is very compact.  If anyone is really big it might be uncomfortable.

Second, while the food is amazing and the decor is well done, you might find their style of service a little off-putting.  For the price and looking at the uniforms, I expected table service.  If you want water, you have to pour it yourself.  They don't take your order, they give you a sticky note with your table number which you take to the register and order/pay there.  They will deliver non-water drinks and your meal, and were pleasant about it.  Honestly, if they could have just taken my order and saved me the trouble of waiting in a Saturday brunch line, that would have been solidly worth the menu prices.

Third, don't order the coffee.  It starts off very nice tasting, but they don't exactly have their espresso dialed in yet.  It finishes very bitter, even with milk and syrup flavor to compensate.  Espresso is more than just an expensive grinder and a good espresso machine.  There is a complex science/art to getting it to match the quality of the food.

Fourth, the furniture is flimsy as all get-out.  It won't collapse on you, but it will flex and have you guessing.",2015-11-02 22:18:59

I need my ""built ins"" creature comforts that exist outside my home that offer me ""society"" and ""comfort"". I would put a ""pit group"" seating environment. When I was a kid we sued togo to the Chart House in Malibu on special occasions. It had a cushioned and chair ring around the fire pit. What can I say I love my fire. The food is great and the good coffee flows freely. They don not seem to mind ""campers"" folks who hand out using internet...they do not even mind if folks sit all day having only bought coffee.It has a kind and caring atmosphere. Great place to start or end your day. I often meet people here for work meeting, social meeting, artistic brain storming and even therapy! Coffee-in fact all beverages are served in china and glass with silver ware. Which is a nice touch. Their disposables are recycled and sturdy.My job can require a sort of camping element. I carry a set of tin ware. Cause I do not like plastic knives. They have quality condiments, games available, a warm haven before and after these especially uncertain days and a truly kind and quirky staff who seems to get and welcome all.

Lost a home and a family of 10 years. When things were the roughest we came here. My son remembered that last night and went up to the counter and asked if they were hiring and the man said...:""well we only hire a certain kind of person here..""
My son said he asked for resume and said "" we will see."" I like that. it showed he is thoughtful I had no idea what my son was doing at the counter. He is normally rather reserved. When he came back to the table he said...""I just asked if they were hiring"". You could have blown me over with a feather. It was sweet. My son and I are all we have on the planet. We have a very hostile landlord who could care less about anyone anyone or anything. The guy has been so abusive...and he and his wife live below us.Let's just say "" we know NO peaceful enjoyment"" in our place. So we often seek out the places that make us feel at home.

LOVED this place so much we went back 2 days in a row on our short weekend Santa Barbara trip. Cute, charming place just off the main State Street that welcomes you with a window of baked goodies. They have indoor and outdoor seating, so we brunched outdoors both days to soak up the beautiful SB weather. No wait either - you just simply order at the register and they bring your food to you. 

The first day, I ordered a veggie asparagus scramble w/ fruit on the side and their home-made biscuits. We also had mimosas which they serve you straight from a personal-sized champagne bottle and little juice pitcher to pour into a champagne glass. Of course I couldn't leave anything behind in the bottle so that pretty much kick-started my day. My BF ordered a Waffle Combination breakfast that came with eggs, potatoes, a biscuit, and the best part - a huge waffle topped w/ whipped cream and fruit. Of course we gobbled it all up and left fat and happy.

The next day, after a long walk along the Waterfront harbor, we were hungry and in search of another brunch place that would live up to the high bar set by Jeannine's. We literally walked ALL across State Street, but couldn't settle on another place with an appetizing menu that even came close. They were either overpriced for nothing special or just plain basics. Feeling a little defeated, we felt the best bet was to go back to Jeannine's, and it did not disappoint! We tried different menu items this time: I got the California Chicken Salad (given that it was already 2pm at this point) and he got ""the best omelet  ever."" I've had many salads in my lifetime but this really topped it - it was colorful with the right balance of different light sweet and salty flavors topped with chicken and nuts. The BEST part of the meal were the Bellini's we ordered - they were so good that we got a second round, this time with sparkling Moscato (my fav wine ever!). Major bonus points for that. So needless to say, we were even more satisfied w/ this meal than the day before, and vowed to myself to return here every time I'm back in SB. 

Oh, and they have delish samples of their baked goodies by the registers! I was already stuffed but wasn't about to pass these up.",2009-12-02 20:13:20

I got an americano and the bean was one of the best I have had in Santa Barbara. I've been living in Washington, DC for 3 years now, and (regretfully) think I have become a bit of a coffee connoisseur (I say regretfully because I dont like being snobby about coffee, but I cant stand a burnt taste or poor roast). I search for good coffee places in SB whenever I am home, and Java Station is top 5 by far!

My one suggestion for Java Station is to have soy milk available as creamer. There are so few places that offer it, but when a cafe does I cant tell you how appreciative I am. I think customers with lactose intolerance a very grateful when a cafe that notices not everyone can drink milk. During a recent visit to SF I noticed that most places had soy available, which made me exceptionally happy because I didnt have to uncomfortably ask the busy barista if I could grab a bit.",2012-03-15 17:45:19

Usually my cappuccino is absolutely wonderful, but I've found it depends on who is making it, sometimes it's just off and more like something just poured into the cup, can be bitter.   I love their avocado / tomato toast and their Lox Deluxe, not as keen on their muffins.  

One reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is the current seating arrangement. I don't like it. I enjoyed the more individual and funky seating that is now long gone.  Loved the couch and comfy chairs and the small tables now it feels like a communal study hall with no particular nice place to sit except for outside with all the cars.  

It can be very crowded and I've been asked to hold off on a food order because of this.  Why not more staff esp at peak times?

I13oRHobm0smQ2SMSQenJw,uDNOaVL4d2x5Np91cEwKSw,Z0mBsgDzDnFAEC5o4X6G9g,4,2,0,0,"I came in with a critical eye, and a desperate need: a bagel with lox.

 I think I'm like a culinary hound dog, because once I get a craving for something, it'll stick with me for days--even months--until it's satisfied. I've been hankering for a good bagel for almost a week now, and the longer the need festers, the more satisfying the experience needs to be to quell it. And after several decidedly unsatisfying experiences, I was getting a bit crazy. 

 Thankfully, this place stepped up and delivered, if not a knockout, then at least a solid beating to my epicurean desire.

I called ahead (previous experience taught me that lox aren't the most common dish for a late brunch in this town. The guy answered my inquiry about their menu with a curt ""yeah."" As if I were stupid for asking about their bagels, as if the only way to possibly prepare a bagel was WITH lox! A good sign, I hoped.

The cafe, is as California as can be: giant yellow building shaded by pineapple-looking trees. Couches and recliners scattered around a lit fireplace (it's 70 degrees outside BTW--- oh in California fires are just to be pretty. I see. ) and an eclectic selection of art ranging from a Buddha statuette on the mantle, flanked by statues of nude woman (but tastefully dune) and a fat baby playing a flute.  The classical music station (which reminded me of WAMC classical--I do love that public radio voice ""that was Johann Von Luxembourg's concerto number 4 in ""D"" major done by the Burlington philharmonic, as conducted...."") sorry, the structured tranquility of classical music seemed to clash with the fuax-artsy, pierced, muscle-bound surfer dude behind the counter, but as I tell myself every morning, ""Welcome to Cali""

But I didn't come for the ambient pleasantries, Oh no. I'm here for the Bagels!

Upon entering the establishment, a menu, handwritten with the daily specials in florescent blue and green chalk, lists Lox Bagel Deluxe as number three. Number three!  Joy upon joy! could they be proud of their food? will they provide the effort in preperation that warrants sure a prominent menu spot? 

Yes. The Bagel was beautiful, or at least pleasantly above average. Way above average, actually. cream cheese, capers, red onion, high quality salmon, fresh tomatoes. The surfer at the counter asked me how I wanted it, and after some deliberation, decided, ""just make it good, do it how you do it, and do it right."" Now I'm not a fan of tomatoes on my bagel, and I usually like a more generous helping of cream cheese, but I wanted to experience the station's offering as they envisioned it. and it was impressive, especially for a coffee shop 2,900 miles away from Katz's on Houston.  It was an open-faced sandwich (which I was not expecting) on a lightly toasted, plain bagel. The little touches like the bit of lemon pepper over the top, or the way the capers were laid into the cream cheese so they wouldn't roll off, those are the touches that show me that they care. Of course, if only they could get some real bagels (the ones they had were alright, small, but fresh with a crusty exterior, yet still lacking), more cream cheese and some dill, I'd give 'em five stars. As it was, I know where I'm going next time I'm craving a little smoked salmon.

We actually started off at Renaud's, which is right down the street, and after seeing the immense line and limited menu we decided to try Jeannine's. Glad we did!

We ordered right away and were seated right away. (Actually, you get to find your own table, stick your number on it, and wait for the food).  The coffee is strong with unlimited refills, and the menu gives you a lot of options!

For his drink my hubby ordered a chai latte. I have to say, this is one of the best chai latte's I've ever had. It was perfect - not too sweet, not too spicy, with a thick layer of foam to keep all the heat in.

Hubby ordered the turkey sausage scramble, which was a generous portion of scrambled eggs with veggies, cheese, and turkey sausage. It came with toast and home made potatoes. Very good!

I got the crab cake benedict. Delicious! Two perfectly moist and fresh crab cakes on top of a toasted english muffin, topped with a poached egg and hollandaise sauce. Also came with potatoes. It was delicious! I asked for a side of hot sauce, and I got that AND some hommade salsa which was SO good.

The service was very nice -- a tad on the slow side, though. I did overhear people at another table chewing out our server for being slow (they were complaining that it took too long to get their food). But, ours came out in a reasonable time.

The other thing -- who was sitting at a table next to us? DR. LAURA! Yes, Dr. Laura, conservative ""family values"" radio host who was kicked off the air (oops, she ""retired"") after using racial slurs, was sitting next to us enjoying her pastries and coffee with some friends. Made for some interesting conversation!

All in all, I'd say GO HERE, especially if Renaud's is too crowded or doesn't suit your fancy.",2011-02-04 23:21:15

Jeannine's is definitely one of my favorites as far as breakfast places go.  I've tried their lobster benedict and the biscuits and gravy.  The lobster Benedict was very good, but also VERY rich!  Given the chance, I probably won't order it again.

Now, the biscuits and gravy are to DIE for.  Living in Bakersfield, we get our fair share of good biscuits and gravy, but the biscuits at Jeannine's is a revelation!  They are perfectly flaky and tantalizingly buttery.  The gravy is savory and creamy.  Together, they make the most satisfying breakfast.

We saw that the two most popular dishes are the Lobster Eggs Benedict and Kahlua Banana French Toast so we ordered those. The Kahlua Banana French Toast is literally the best French toast I've ever had. The Kahlua just brings out an additional flavor that I've never had with French toast and it was amazing. The lobster eggs Benedict was equally amazing as the lobster adds a good flavor to a traditional meal of eggs Benedict. Definitely returning to this place for breakfast.,2016-02-07 19:41:56

I had also ordered a cappuccino dry - they knew what that meant and did a good job. The meal was nearly perfect - my only note is that the potatoes were a tad under-cooked; however, this could well be a matter of taste, so I can't really ding them for it. I should also note that I felt great all morning, as this was a pretty healthy breakfast. It's a nice place with some outdoor seating; indoors, if you like to sit by yourself, there's a counter with a few seats, and several seats at a bar that juts out from the window.

It's a gem, tucked away in a not-so-glam-not-so-cute strip mall setting. You order at the counter, take a number, and seat yourself. The service is excellent, and the food is DELICIOUS.

The huz and I couldn't decided on what to order so we ordered ""everything"" - well, everything we wanted to try. We ordered a lobster benedict, dungeness crab omelet, kahlua banana french toast, strawberry banana smoothie, and coffee to start (yes, to start). 

The lobster benedict was served with a small bowl of fruit. The fruit was ""meh"" (melons aren't in season), but the benedict was definitely one of the best my husband and I had ever had. The poached eggs were beautiful, the lobster was sweet and were allowed to shine, the hollandaise sauce wasn't too thick, and the english muffin held its own (I hate a soggy muffin). The thinly sliced potatoes were perfectly-seasoned. The husband and I could not stop smiling as we ate.

The dungeness crab omelet was also lovely, but not quite as mind-blowing as the lobster benedict. Not on its own, that is. But layered with the sprouts that accompany the dish and topped with Cholula hot sauce, it is excellent. Omelet came served with a small fruit bowl and choice of bread. We chose the English muffin. Probably should've tried a biscuit! Everything is good here...

The kahlua banana french toast. No syrup required. A dessert passing itself off as breakfast. I'll take it! HEAVENLY. The huz and I couldn't stop going back and forth between our savory entrees and this one. So happy we didn't skip this order.

Smoothie was nice and tart (lady at the counter asked if we wanted a juice or milk based smoothie, and we went with the juice), coffee (from Peet's) was strong as is necessary when one has a child...

A happy place for hungry tummies...

Couldn't leave empty-handed, so we left with a box of scones. We don't even like scones. But we were so happy that we bought 'em. Shared a chocolate chip one when we got home. (Toasted sans cream or butter.) YUM!",2014-02-02 20:29:20

Anyway, I am not THAT creepy, i just enjoyed the grandma couple action because my grandpa and great aunts always have coffee every Wednesday. They even mark ""Coffee time"" on their calendars. I hope I get to have regular coffee (or sandwich) time when I'm older... 

They gave me free avocado on my turkey sandwich and a free upgrade from a small to a large iced tea (light ice) so i'm happy. The turkey sandwich was amazing. The turkey wasn't that disgusting, congealed, soggy, super processed stuff (ahem ahem goleta coffee co). They were out of peppercinis, onions and tri tip today because they were closed the past two days so I will have to make another trip out here VERY SOON. 

the interior is really cute. everything is mismatched but that adds to the coziness. lots of wood, lots of windows, lots of tables and chairs, lots of really worn in couches = max comfort but also a small fear of finding bugs in the couch (ahem ahem mojo coffee), patio seating. more outlets than most coffee places in goleta/SB although i could see this pain being a huge pain during midterms/finals

it's a warm, sunny day and they have the doors open so there's a nice breeze and surprisingly, NO FLIES!

also, they are playing classical music which is so refreshing after mojo's or coffee cat. i love coffee cat but had to stop going because EVERY DAY they played nina simone ""aint got no."" nothing against her or the song but EVERY DAY..? ok i feel bad, mojo's and coffee cat doesn't (usually) have bad music but i'm actually trying to get some work done and get a degree (or yelp). just saying. 

i also have had their lox bagel on a wheat bagel which was really good. the cream cheese was melted because they put it on the bagel immediately out of the toaster which isn't my preference. it comes with a generous portion of lox (unlike bagel cafe), capers and tomato. the tomato was ORANGE and kind of crunchy so that detracted a little but overall a very tasty bagel. i drank 17 cups of water after though because lox + capers + i'm sensitive to salty foods (odd because i'm Korean)

It opens at 6am! They have coffee, yogurt, bakery goods, blended coffee drinks, packaged snacks breakfast burritos, fruit and much more.

The guy who was working was friendly and helpful.  They sell a few gift items like magnets, coasters and cookbooks. It was busy, but not swamped.  You can buy a wine machine card for $20 or $40--it's a novelty because you will leave money on it!  None of the pours work out equally to $20, but it's fun and cute!

They had just started selling everything 2x1 to clear the case for the day. I ordered a bear claw and a chocolate chip scone. I don't normally go with scones unless they are packed with delicious fruit, but I wanted some chocolate (the scone was the only thing left in the case that contained chocolate). I would say the scone was too dry, the kind you can't eat without making a huge crumb disaster. The ""bear claw"" was more like a croissant shaped like a claw with almonds and frosting. The bear claw I know is more of a donut with glaze and nuts- but maybe that's my Midwest upbringing. Generally rather disappointed in the pastries, but at least they are 2x1 at the end of the day.

I think anything you get is a good idea. I suggest you make sure you specify if you want it in a mug or a so-called ""to go"" cup like they serve you at Starbucks etc. If not they will give it to you in a giant mug. Same thing goes with the food, they will give it to you on a plate. 

Right now they have agave latte! SOOOOOO good. Just enough sugar and you can taste the hint of agave (which is a natural sweetner.) I think all coffee places should have this.

Being just a few blocks from our cottage, it was our favorite brunch spot, and we'd built a rapport with the staff there. So, we were excited to hear another location was opening by the beach, even though it's a little bit more of a hike for us. We've visited a couple times, now, and have been thrilled to see what Lalo (manager) and staff have done with the space! The service they provide has always been top-notch, in our experience, and this location is no different.

The interior of the restaurant is light, bright and airy, with beautifully tempting displays of fresh pastries and other baked goods by the registers. We stopped by this afternoon for lunch, about an hour before closing and were *extra* tempted by the 2-for-1 deal on pastries, but we opted for a heartier brunch and ordered a couple plates of their classic eggs benedict. The eggs were cooked perfectly, nice and runny inside, and the fruit and potatoes were just right. The hollandaise, as always, was light and lemony. I'm really picky about restaurant brewed coffee, finding most of it to be weak and bland. But, Jeannine's brews theirs right, and today's cup was as expected: dark and rich but not bitter. So yummy!

On weekends, I particularly love their biscuits and sausage gravy as a side to their classic American breakfast of eggs, meat, and potatoes. But, you can't go wrong with their waffles, breakfast burrito, or burger, if you're in the mood for lunch. 

The succulent-laden patio is where this particular location really shines, with plenty of shade provided by bright yellow and white umbrellas, hovering over a large collection of tables, sharing views of Cabrillo Blvd, West Beach, and Stearns Wharf.

They had blueberries to put on top but also some mixed into the middle of the pancake, which tasted delicious. The breakfast quesadilla was also really great and was cooked so it was crisp on the outside and flavorful on the inside.",2019-08-01 01:22:51

After a few more breakfast outings, I have to say the brioche French toast from here is my favorite. I'm not a huge French toast person but every time I come back here I already know what I want to order. The orange juice is nice and sour, and the Havana latte is soooo good. I usually end up ordering both for drink as it's so difficult to decide which one to get! My only con is it can be a bit pricey, but the food is so delicious.

It took a while to decide but I went with the Banana Kahlua French Toast and my girlfriend opted for the Breakfast Burrito, after we asked the hostess what was most popular on the breakfast/brunch menu.

You order at the counter, pay and tip before receiving food or a drink, which I thought was a bit awkward. You're given a number which is placed on your table and the food is brought out to you. Coffee is self-serve after you're given an empty mug, or paper cup upon request. Coffee choices cycle and my options for Easter Sunday brunch today were Guatemalan or Columbian dark roasts, or decaf. Filled up on one of the darks and took my seat.

Our plates came out in decent time. We must have just beat the rush arriving at 9 AM because the line was out the door after we ordered. I was glad we didn't feel rushed to finish our meals though (major pet peeve of mine when that happens).

The French Toast was heavy, sweet and full of flavor! Nothing overwhelming - it was just what I expected when I ordered it. The banana slices were hot, which was a pleasant treat. The breakfast burrito was a bit greasy, but with 'American' and 'Bakery' in the restaurants name, I wouldn't expect Mexican to be their specialty, but my girlfriend and I can never resist a breakfast burrito when we see one on the menu. We've had better though so maybe skip this next time.

The sausage was delicious and there were four links so there was plenty to fill me up. I also had nonfat milk and fresh-squeezed orange juice. I had to force myself to get all this food down, LOL.

They also have this amazing bar setup right above it - wow wow wow I can't wait to come back tonight for dinner!

This cafe seems like the quintessential American brunch place. All of your favorites, including french toasts (regular, banana, blueberry), egg dishes, pastries, and coffee. Their menu is large and varied, including breakfast/brunch and lunch options. All of the staff are super friendly and the food comes out quickly. 

This is a really great spot to come if you have a larger group (4-6 people) because you order and pay for your food first at the counter and then it is delivered to your table. This prevents any annoying check splitting afterwards. However, the seating is first-come first-served so you sort of have to stalk the tables once it gets kind of busy. This has the potential to be irritating, but the servers do a good job of helping you find space when it gets crazy.

Both of the entrees that I got were really great. One day I got the egg scramble with turkey sausage. The amount of food was perfect and the presentation was really nice. The potatoes that come with it are really good - be sure to ask for some of their homemade salsa and spread that on top. The second time I went, I got the regular french toast, which was enormous and came with eggs and choice of meat....as well as a great side of fruit.

They have a small area in front with high top tables (& an ocean view) where you can order coffee/pastries/dessert as well buy packaged nuts, cookies and other items made/sourced locally.  A good amount of indoor seating and I liked the vibe in their outdoor space!

Now the Brownies/Bars which were a revelation.  Ordered some to sample.  Apricot Almond Bar, Chocolate Salted Carmel and Chocolate Frosted Brownies.  All 3 were so rich/decadent with fruit, amazing chocolate-to be enjoyed a little at a time & kept well in the refrigerator.

I love that all these wineries in town are now providing a wide variety of games to play while grabbing a drink with friends, but hate to break it to them Java Station is the games OG in town.

They recently switched their coffee beans and are now using Hatch which I find to be a pretty decent brand, no complaints. They have a good variety of ice-blended espresso based drinks which if you know me is totally my weakness, and they serve them (For Here) in these super tall glass cups that make you feel fun and fancy.

Formerly our daily bread, there was a sign that said Bree'osh. Was this the same as the one in Montecito? Well, let me just say the pastries are still amazing. Freshly baked sourdough and other breads throughout the table display- the smell was so good  Baker pastries may have been better if I asked to have them toasted and warmed, but not to their fault, just a preference.

ham and cheese- flaky shell with great ham and cheese. I wish I had this when freshly baked it would probably be even more amazing.

Chocolate almond croissant - this was an interesting mix. I love both chocolate croissants for almond croissants, but together? This was new. It's not truly mixed together as I thought, but rather they are compartmentalized so that if you want a mixed but you need to take a few bites or a huge bite across the croissant. That being said I enjoyed the pastry! Two in one!

Bostock- it's an almond croissant on brioche bread. I love me some almond croissants, but decided to try out this treat instead. Let's just say no one makes this combo pastry in the central coast (someone please let me know if there is). The brioche nuns and slathered with almond filling and you can separate them to eat the brioche and filling alone or the brioche with the almond nuts on top... So delicious. It's not crispy and flaky, but when warmed, soft and buttery.

Chocolate croissant- can't complain, not super fresh from the oven, but after a short time in the oven, viola! Crispy flaky goodness with gooey chocolate inside

You order at the counter and then find a table either indoors or outdoors. The space isn't too big, so if you're with a large group, it may be difficult to find seating. Staff was super friendly.

If you're a sweet brunch person, the banana Kahlua French toast is a MUST! The challah bread is fluffy and not too eggy as some french toasts can be, and the caramelized, Kahlua glazed bananas on top are sweet goodness. The Norwegian Benedict was nice and light with the smoked salmon, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The breakfast burrito was too heavy for me though. I loved the grilled tortilla, but the fillings alone were quite mushy. The crispy home fries on the side and salsa were much needed to add a bit of crunch and to cut the richness of the cheesy eggs and bacon. Nonetheless, Jeannine's honestly has a special place in my heart, and it's because of that banana Kahlua French toast!",2022-01-12 23:49:00

The restaurant was easy to find and there was ample parking and seating available for us.  You order at the counter by the way, and also, there is self serve water.
I choose this place to eat because of the reviews on the French toast - and oh boy, it did not disappoint.

To start, we shared the breakfast burrito.  It was the perfect size for us and the cut potato that comes with it, also includes ham and sweet potato - a nice addition!  Oh, and the salsa was so good we had to ask for another cup.

Now, the Kahlua French toast.  I LOVED it.  As you can see by the photos, it is basically a breakfast dessert.  UH-MAZE-ING.  My boyfriend preferred to eat the parts of the toast that were not completely soaked in the syrup / bananas - and he really enjoyed that.  I of course, stuffed my face with whatever he didn't want.

Right when you walk in, you're greeted by the friendly staff whether it's the nice lady giving out menus to the people in line on weekends or the ladies at the registers who take your order. 

The place has a Gilmore Girls' Luke's Diner type-of-feel to it albeit a little classier. While the restaurant might not be too big, the State St. Ontare location does have a pretty fast patron turnover. There is also an overflow dining room aside from the primary dining area. 

Take note that you have to order at the register before you sit. That explains why there is usually a line on the weekends. Don't let that deter you from eating here though because the staff is capable of getting through the line quickly without sacrificing genuine customer service.

The only thing that sucks about coming here is the parking situation. Finding a place to park your car will probably take longer than waiting in line to order.

Now, let's talk about the food!

The breakfast/brunch menu has your classic breakfast fare from French toast to omelettes to pancakes and waffles, but where Jeannine's excels is taking the seemingly ordinary and improving them by making up for what the ordinary usually lacks. 

ll Breakfast Burrito ll
This is my go-to pick whenever I come. It's packed with scrambled eggs, juicy tomatoes, and smoky bacon. I'm also grateful that the stringy, melted cheese does not overpower the other flavors like cheese sometimes does to any breakfast dish. What takes the breakfast burrito from an 8/10 to 10/10 are the jalapeño-cilantro tortilla that's used to wrap the burrito and the poblano pepper salsa used for dipping. Both things give the burrito an extra kick that ranges between mild and moderate heat. Moreover, the tortilla does not leave that floury aftertaste some tortillas can in Mexican cuisine.

ll Banana Kahlua French Toast ll
Want something on the sweeter side? Get what Jeannine's is known for: French toast. This dish shows that the category of ""sweet"" can be subdivided into many categories. The Banana Kahlua French Toast is able to marry the sweet and sour natural flavor of the bananas with the cocoa, spicy sweetness of the Kahlua glaze to a point where each bite is not an abrupt, overwhelming sugar rush but a comforting, sweet embrace that can give you the energy to conquer the day ahead. Last but not least, how can I not talk about the challah bread? Jeannine's bakes it fresh daily, so you never have to worry about day-old bread that's hardened. The texture remains light and fluffy but is able to keep from getting soggy drenched under the syrup and glaze.

ll Pineapple Coconut Scone ll
There are so many pastries in the case from the assortment of cookies that I get for my pharmacy technicians on the weekends I work to the cakes that are light and subtly sweet. My favorite, however, is the pineapple coconut scone. Unfortunately, Jeannine's does not sell it daily, which is a shame, but whenever I see it in the case, I always get one....or six! The scones here are NOT dry. They have an inner texture akin to a biscuit with an outer firmness more similar to a traditional scone. The pineapple gives the scone this natural, slight sweet flavor while the shreds of coconut make the scone a refreshing treat. 

Come for breakfast. Come for lunch (which they also serve). Come whenever they're open. Jeannine's Bakery is a must for any local or any tourist because you will be guaranteed a hearty meal, congenial service, and a start to your day with a smile on your face.

Awesome service despite a full house and growing waiting line-- three different people made sure we didn't need anything whenever I broke eye contact with my date. Park in their dedicated lot, and order at the counter while your dining companion snags a table. Try to resist the huge pastries, because portioning here is for feasting.

Large beverages are no joke here! I was proper caffeinated for the day with our sweet drinks; I preferred the dark mocha over the havana latte. Seasoning is DIY, but the fundamentals were delicious. I definitely had FOMO watching the banana kahlua french toast go by (challah for the yum), but I can't deny that our breakfast burrito and Dungeness omelet hit the spot. They weren't shy about packing my fluffy egg bed with crab meat, the fruit bowl was appropriately ripe, and the potato medley wasn't too greasy. A variety of hot sauce bottles are available to dine with by the water tap. Pick a biscuit instead of toast if you can, the sourdough is the dullest thing here.

Someday I'll be back to stuff my face and try: matcha chai latte, flat white; lemon tea bread, almond bear claw, blueberry streusel muffin, pineapple coconut scone; lobster benedict, apple jack or banana kahlua french toast, lemon poppy seed pancakes.",2018-05-22 06:38:02

I've seen many friends go here for brunches and birthdays, and I can't believe it took me three years of being in SB to finally go! It's the cutest spot for photos and has a very ""family bakery"" vibe.

We ordered the Norwegian Benedict with potatoes, two blueberry scones, and a chai latte. We shared the benedict and maaan... we got SO FULL. The photos looked unassuming and when the dish came out, the portions were decent (especially for the price), but it filled us up quick! The scones were delicious too. They weren't warm and little wet on the bottom (maybe after the heated it up on the plate?) but we didn't mind. We would definitely think of getting scones here for a DIY afternoon tea. I think the only flavors there were blueberry and lemon glaze? As for the chai latte, it's already sweet. It was very milky but it paired well with my food.

The reason for 4 stars is there are two locations on State street. I placed my order at the wrong one (my bad). However, when I got to the new beach street location, the waitress checked on my order (twice) and said it would be ready soon. So I waited and waited for 20 mins, then stopped the manager (?) showed him my order and he informed me I was at the wrong location. That would be ok, if I had a car...and hadn't been waiting 20 mins already after being told my order was there. He put a new order in, gave me a free coffee, but a said he had to charge for breakfast...good thing I was hungry. On the way back to my hotel I called the other Jeannine's and they said he should have not charged, this happens. There will be a refund, with a free a cup of coffee, and am enjoying delicious avocado toast...but was late for a meeting (minus the star).

This bakery is family owned and that's the experience you get when dining here. They get pretty busy so if you're planning to dine here for breakfast I recommend coming early. Weekends are busier than weekdays I've noticed.

My most recent order was the breakfast club sandwich and let me just tell you this was pretty amazing! The ingredients were fresh and they didn't skimp on the smoked applewood bacon. I ordered mine on sourdough but they have several choices of bread to choose from. I could only eat half since it was a good size portion. Plus the potatoes so this will definitely fill you up! 

The scones are a must try! Made fresh daily and they offer many choices such as raspberry, lemon, pumpkin pecan, blueberry, strawberries & cream plus more! These are light, fluffy, and melt in your mouth. 

I've also had their white chocolate strawberry cake. This by far takes the cake and deserves an award. No lie it's that good! Give it a try.

My girlfriend had a mushroom and cheese croissant sandwich-- it was earthy, mushrooms seared with a good bite and not soggy, cheese melting over the side.

I mean, we love certain kinds of breads, but I don't think we truly appreciate all kinds, like others do.  At least, this applies to croissants... and flaky breads of that nature.  It might even apply to brioche.  The jury's still out on that.

Here's the thing.... we enjoyed (I enjoyed more than my husband) the sampling of Bree'osh pastries that we bought, but it wasn't earth-shatteringly amazing (like I wanted them to be).  Here's what we sampled....

1 Kouign Amann
2 Cinnamon Raisin rolls
1 Chocolate Almond Croissant
1 Bostok Almond Brioche

I think they were well prepared, but then, we have no point of reference.  The kouign amann was my favorite because it had a crispy, crunchy, caramelized shell of brown sugar/ cinnamon-y sweetness, which I really liked.  The chocolate almond croissant was just okay.  Nobody ever... anywhere... puts enough chocolate in the croissant.  I don't ever understand that, but that's how it's constructed no matter who makes the croissant.  The bostok almond brioche had a nice amount of almond cream, but in terms of the bread component, it was good, but not a standout.  The cinnamon raisin roll definitely didn't have enough raisins, and it was just sort of bland to me.

Again, I think part of the problem is me and my husband and our ambivalence towards these kinds of breads.  We tried them, they were good, but they didn't make us swoon, either.  I think it's 4 stars worthy (my husband said 3, but he's not writing the review), and I'm still glad I tried them.  Bree'osh was definitely on my radar !!",2021-07-08 00:59:07

While I do enjoy many coffee shops in town, Java Station often has a few perks that places it toward the top.
- Shorter line for friendly service
- Better food offerings
- Decent amount of parking and seating
- High speed Wi-Fi (not sure how this is possible in town)
- Welcoming to all (they celebrate Pride, Halloween and beyond)
- They have games available to play
- It brings a sense of community to an odd little neighborhood (What the heck is it considered?! Noleta? Or Hope Ranch Annex? ...Now we are just getting particular...)
I enjoy their Klatch Coffee Co. espresso which is bold without being acidic or underbearing. I often order the Oat Milk Vanilla Latte (yah, I'm basic), yet recently ordered a fall/winter special of Maple Bourbon Latte which I'm a big fan of.

My favorite here is the Caldo de Res. It's a beef soup served in a huge bowl with fresh homemade flour tortillas on the side. Perfect on a cold rainy day! I also love their chicken enchiladas. You get a serving of 3 with rice and beans. I normally can't finish my meals but I can eat this whole plate because it's that delicious.

The albondigas soup is made with a chipotle based stock. This soup is too spicy for me! I wish they would make it simple with and nix the chipotle. Even my friend who can tolerate spicy food wasn't able to enjoy it.

My 12 year old son and I are on a mission to find the best Pan Dulce in our travels.  So far ""La Mexicana"" bakery in San Francisco's Mission district is the winner, but for a local spot, Daniel's is probably our #2 favorite in town.

The weekend morning selection is very diverse, but tends more towards the flaky pastries, cookies, and fancier styles as opposed to more basic cuernos de azucar and conchas.   It is a traditional type of panaderia  (bakery) where you grab some tongs and a tray and make your way through the various cases of baked goods.

Be sure to look into the kitchen to see what is cooling down on the racks - there may be something back there that is NOT out front and you don't want to miss your favorites.

The stuffed turnover type pastries are usually very good, but impossible to tell what's inside unless you ask or just go for it.  Typically they will have  pineapple, custard, and apple empanadas.  I have not yet seen them feature camote (sweet potato) or pumpkin  (might be a regional thing).

If you plan to stay and eat your pan dulce there at their little tables, you might want to bring your own beverage unless you want can of Monster or Snapple with breakfast.  They don't sell individual milk and their coffee is pretty bland and weak.

four stars for the selection and quality of the pastries and bread, minus one star for the lack of breakfast beverage offerings",2011-11-12 17:03:07

I've been searching for my go to breakfast/lunch spot since my favorite place closed a few years ago. I have found it!! I live an hour way and make special trips just to eat some of this delicious food And I wouldn't do that for ""ok"" food. It's worth the trip!! I also couldn't be happier to be in support of one of my best friends life dreams. 

Alessia is an inspiration and living proof that if you put your mind to something, stay at it even when it's hard, dreams really do come true! I could not be more proud of her and accomplishing her goal. You did it girl!

Despite my casual attire, the bright, white interior with chandeliers made me feel fancy and sophisticated. Our server Parker was welcoming and great! 

My boyfriend and I enjoyed our surprise of complimentary mini chocolate croissants. With beautiful lamination, they were crunchy on the outside and flaky. I was a fan of the croissant sandwich with poached eggs and smoked salmon. The croissant didn't get soggy with the toppings, and the sides of roasted tomatoes and potatoes tasted delicious and well seasoned. The mushroom toast was yummy, but I wish it came with a side salad or something because $16.50 for just the toast was kind of a lot. I was (and still am, honestly) dying to try their stunning desserts, but I couldn't bring myself to casually buy them because of their steep price.

I went a bit out of control my first visit with my ordering.  Tried numerous croissants, pastries and breakfast items.  The croissants are hands down the best in town, light flakey, and filled with flavour. I had the breakfast sandwich also, the brioche bread it is served on nearly melts in your mouth but isn't overly ""greasy"", and the bacon...ohhh the bacon, its a fat kids dream perfectly cooked!  Also, after seeing all the pics, I had to try the avocado toast.  Usually this is too trendy and/or ""basic"" for me but Alessia executed this so well, delicate yet filling(Although, I may add bacon to it next time). 

I enjoyed my experience so much that I actually called in and had them cater my office meeting this week.  Agents loved it, they made ""mini"" croissants, scones, and quiche.  The perfect size for everyone to get a taste of everything and something different to go with coffee.

There was also a little container of smoky chipotle mayo that went great on the sandwich.  I also got the mole enchilada.

The Jugo Verde was delicious and had pineapple, celery, carrots and cactus (I think). I loved it!

When I got our salads home, they looked so good we couldn't wait to dig in!! These were not salads that had been sitting in a cold case all day. These were fresh and delicious salads even down to the house made dressings. I've been in the hunt for a good ""big salad"" on the eastside and I think I found my spot.

The vanilla latte I ordered was good too. The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because I thought it was an all day breakfast cafe.",2022-01-08 23:19:52

I've been disappointed over & over when trying chile rellenos at restaurants, but I'm so glad I trusted Tarascos with this beloved dish o'mine.  At first bite, I was pleasantly surprised to find that their chile rellenos taste just like my Tia Coco's, which I think of day & night.

Before my chile relleno discovery, I'd always go for their also-bueno breakfast ham & egg burrito,  regardless of time of day.  I love their light red salsa, so I'd drench my burrito in it.  

In addition to food (burritos, tortas, salads), Tarascos has great pan dulce variety; The cup-shaped cheese cakes mentioned in previous reviews are called ""ratones.""  They also have a buncha natural juice smoothie options; I usually go with their Vampiro (beets & other veggies), but today I tried a smoothie for ""la fatiga"" (fatigue): blended avocados, orange juice, soy milk & honey made for a tasty green smoothie.  I'm looking forward to trying their ""arroz con leche"" (sweet rice).

They have a small table for two or stools facing Haley where you can sit to treat your tastebuds.

I love being inside Tarascos, because for those ten (take-out) or thirty (eat-in) minutes, I experience Mexico.",2011-04-13 06:47:46

After spending a copious amount of in Europe eating croissants for breakfast every morning, these are on par if not better! They even accommodated my modifications to the breakfast sandwich so it was exactly as I wanted it. The breakfast sandwich was one of the best I've had! Big portion too, big enough to split if you're not looking to indulge.  It came with a choice of sides, I got the smashed potatoes, very good and unique compared to tradition breakfast potatoes, makes me want to replicate the potato recipe at home. My friend got the gone bananas, similar to French toast but with Nutella and bananas! I tried some of hers and I'd go back again and again and again for that dish!

The pastry counter is open at 7 but breakfast isn't served until 8. It's right across from the El Presido with a clean, classy interior.

Breakfast: We got the crab crepe, french toast, and granola yougurt for the kids. Everything was well-cooked and beautifully plated, especially the yogurt dish. Only feedback is slightly too much hollandaise on the crepes and the french toast was a little soggy on bottom. Otherwise high quality and well portioned. 

We wanted to give the kids some solid food and ordered a croissant, it was so good we got up while waiting for our breakfast and got more pastries for later.

Pastries: 5 stars, the croissant is better than the one at Bouchon and Alexanders. It has an incredible outside crunchy layer and soft cloud-like inside. Cheddar bacon scone and kouign-amann also amazing, loved having these for a quality breakfast the next day.",2022-01-09 00:52:12

Santa Barbara's newest patisserie is just a stone's throw away from the Presidio and two doors down from Handlebar. The space stood empty for a couple years, replacing Miso Hungry (which replaced Sojourner Cafe). They did a great job renovating the interior, it's very clean and pristine.

As you enter, there's a pastry display case immediately to your left with different kinds of croissants, muffins, cookies, etc.  There's also a refrigerated display case with cakes, macarons, and other desserts. Sit-down dining is on the right if you're planning to stay for breakfast or lunch. But if you're just grabbing a coffee/treat to-go, they'll take your order and ring you up by the counter.

The Pistachio croissant caught my eye when I first walked in. It had a beautiful golden color to it... with half of the pastry dipped in a white chocolate glaze that's been tinted with a light green hue, topped with chopped pistachios and candied rose pearls. Their pistachio paste is imported from Southern Italy, and is incorporated into the cream they make for the inside filling. Great balance of buttery and flakey, you can tell how freshly made it was. I'm personally not too crazy about the filling, I thought it could do without.

Their drinks are from Verve, a roaster based in Santa Cruz. The latte I got was enjoyable; it was very light on the milk, which brought out the full flavor of the coffee.

They were lovely and let me order a couple minutes before opening-Thank you. Walking in, I felt like I was in France or New York. The lines are clean and the shop design has a more refined feel than typically found in Santa Barbara. Not stuffy, just of another place.
I got 3 standards so I could see how they do with the basics. Bravo! The chocolate in the chocolate croissant was dark and a bit hard and reminded me of mornings in Paris. The almond croissant was not sweet; how I prefer it. Lots of almonds on top that combined nicely with the filling inside-lightly filled not goopy or heavy. The plain croissant was good. Not totally light but very good and baked with the right ""crisp/softness' ratio. I have no doubt they will evolve and get even better.

I was very surprised to discover this little French gym right downtown. It reminded me of places in France I had been. I ordered the French onion soup and a half grilled cheese sandwich with aged cheddar and gruyere, onion jam (caramelized) on  sourdough. 

It was so delicious I ordered one to go! It really was such a generous portion that I could barely finish the soup but I ""forced"" myself and left a token sip of the broth in the .tureen. Full of onions, cheese, bread, and delicious savory broth. No skimping on their portions or the recipe. 

The grilled cheese with onion jam was on toasted buttery sourdough and melted in your mouth! It was not too large or too much bread but just right to go along with the soup. It really was the tastiest grilled cheese I've ever had in my 71 years of life, and that's not an exaggeration! 

I cannot wait to return here with friends to try several items i saw as the staff were serving others. It was quite a spectacle actually has several of them paraded by together with plateful's of fantastic looking foods presented beautifully. It reminded me of a fashion show but he might see on television in France showing there new creations off. 

I commented to my friend that it looked like a parade! My kind of parade for sure! I found the price is reasonable and so will not be prohibited by that factor. 

Another nice added touch is they bring your bill to the table in a little machine and you don't have to go check out somewhere or wait for the staff to go process your credit card and then come back. It's done right at the table and your CC never leaves your sight. I regret to inform you that 

I did not try any of their pastries as I am on a New Year's resolution to cut them out till I takeoff my Covid weight and then some but I promise you as you will see in my pictures everything looks fantastic!

js2nrDhpb2uUkVTSeMCeFA,zPPNyikI-w9w9v66aXIikw,WVNkMz4sEl35swjVtKHOFw,4,1,1,2,"Alessia got her croissant right; the outside crunch is there and the center is soft and chewy, which all I really care about. My go to order will always be a plain croissant with jam, so based off this point alone, Alessia's Patisserie has earned their extra star in my book. 

I strive to keep my reviews unbiased and uninfluenced by anyone- including an establishment offering me free goods or services.  So after the the owner reached out here on Yelp, I decided to go back to Alessia's on my own to try the same pastries that I had before giving the allowance for the possibility of damage during transit of my birthday treats from my first review (like maybe they got dried out in the car or something) which were dry and too sweet. 

When I took a look at the bakery case I realized that I would've chosen completely different pastries to begin with as I am not a fan of Pear ( never actually seen a pear cake before) or pumpkin ( just kind of over it) ! So when I I figured out what was in mine I decided to go for what I like instead. 

Although I do find the desert pastries at Alessia patisserie to be a bit too sweet and in my opinion, ""avant-garde "", with twists and reinventions on the classics that sometimes undermine the original versions rather than enhance them- I will say- everything is top-notch in quality. 

For example, I appreciate Chef Jordan Pilarski's take on a lemon chiffon tart. It is different from the traditional lemon chiffon tart you would find at a French patisserie because the meringue top is not flame torched  and the lemon curd is slightly gelatinous making it bouncier than the traditional creamy lemon custard version. This was actually good! It reminded me of a high class version of those  Jell-O pudding pies with Cool Whip that I was never allowed to have as a kid. It tasted lighter than the Lemon Tarts I've had elsewhere. I also really enjoyed the raspberry center. It was still overly sweet for my taste, but the acidity from the lemon balanced out the sweetness like lemonade. Out of everything I tried, this tart was my favorite and not surprisingly, as it was pretty traditional apart from the custard texture, soft chiffon, and raspberry center. 

I also really enjoyed the chiffon top, as it was not toasted which made it light and airy. The raspberry was a bit off center but maybe consistency and tradition aren't Alessia's aim. Either way,  there's no denying the flavor was delicious. 

I also tried an intricately designed eclair with cranberry in it. The presentation on this was beautiful, as with all of the pastries at Alessia's . Once again I felt that the flavor was just a little too convoluted for me with orange zest overpowering the other flavors but as far as execution the pastry was perfect.

Finally, I see a lot of reviews commenting on the price being high. I believe my pastries were all between $12-15 for a single item. The owner has responded that the prices reflect higher than average wages for her staff which I hear is true! I personally feel there is no limit to good quality and service and I do believe that the pastries are a rare indulgence so I don't mind paying higher than average prices for them. I am curious as to the etiquette for tipping and if it is included, I saw no indication. 

My only recommendation would be that they adjust the boxes to fit the size of the pastries or vise versa and implement a ""crutch"" ( I made my own- see photo) to prevent sliding because they do get pretty jumbled during transition.",2022-01-05 06:31:17

For one thing, they serve a variety of breads with every meal, accompanied by a personal delivery of your alcoholic beverage and/or dessert. The restaurant's vibe is great, with live music often being played on the heated patio.

People here generally seem like they want to be at Fresco (and nowhere else.) There dogs too.

Me likely. Keep it coming.",2011-08-26 07:14:04

Friendly staff, my go to place after an extended day at work and just can't cook. One strong complaint, however, is they continue to serve soup in styrofoam containers after so many years.

Before heading over to SB for the day, i decided to find a good spot to have lunch. My friend Maria was in the mood for a sandwich, and i was in the mood for a really good salad. Well, we wanted to try something different from our usual, Silvergreens, and Fresco looked like the perfect substitution. 

When we got there and took a look at their specials for the day, i noticed that one of the deals was: a slice of either margherita or roasted garlic/mushroom/asiago cheese pizza w/ a salad for like $7. Ummm, yes please. I decided to upgrade the salad to the gorgonzola walnut salad for an additional $1 or $2, but of course, picky ass me doesn't like gorgonzola so i substituted it for feta :]. And i couldn't decide between getting fresh lemonade or iced tea, so i mixed them. As for Maria, she totally changed her mind about wanting a sandwich when margherita pizza was thrown into the mix. She ended up getting a slice of that w/ chinese chicken salad. 

Well, both of us were practically hyperventilating and on the verge of tears because our meals were so damn perfect. It was exactttlllyyy what i needed, and it put me in a good mood the rest of the day. The pizza was SO good. Generous with the mushrooms, and with whole roasted garlic cloves (now, most people aren't fans of the whole garlic thing, but i'm not most people. I could eat that shit like candy.), and the asiago cheese gave it some extra tang. I've seriously been craving this meal since i left. 
They had lots of baked goodies that looked really good, i just didn't have any room left in my stomach after i forced myself to finish my entire meal. I also noticed that they offer some beer & wine. Sweeet.

Next time i'm in SB, i'll definitely be eating here again. And i'll be sure to make a conscious effort to save room for dessert & some wine. :)

Best chicken tortilla soup I have ever had in my life (they don't have it every day though) and an excellent caeser salad (they do have that every day).  Pizzas are excellent too.

A display full of insanely decadent desserts will be staring you in the face as soon as you walk in to place your order...and they are hard to resist.  If you are one of those people like me willing to blow your diet a few days each month, this is the place you should come to do it!  I highly recommend the mixed-berry pie if they have it (selections change every day).  They serve it with a scoop of home-made whipped cream and it is good beyond description.

What I love about it is the walnut gorgonzola salad which you can upgrade any salad that comes with your meal to this one for $1.00 more. Do it! I have loved their quiche, but one time it was too something with a strange texture. I also love their desserts, especially the flourless chocolate cake which you need to ask for it to be heated and dolloped with their homemade whipped cream. What they do like nobody else is their light & creamy cheese cake with fresh berries on top. It tastes so fresh & not dense like a NY cheesecake. 

Other than that, they make a decent  BLT. They have some great soups and chowders. Usually we'd get a special from the board rather than something off the menu. 

I'm not a fan of their cupcakes though because they taste too airy to me with a chocolate buttercream frosting that has a weird bite with lack of chocolate flavor. Just me I know. I am picky. It reminds me of a storebought cupcake.",2013-04-14 03:37:11

It is located in a plaza where Ross, Albertson's, Carl's Jr's,  Blockbuster & Blenders is. It is just as fast and easy as most of the other fast food establishments.

Fresco's is a GREAT alternative for anyone who is tired of burgers & burritos. They have great salads, pastas, sandwiches, little bites, pastries and much more.

The first few times I was in the plaza, I ignored it. I had no idea what it was, but I saw so many people come in and out, that it intrigued me.

I went inside one day, grabbed a menu and I was impressed! Since then, I have been coming to this place whenever I am in town.

My favorite salad is the Gorgonzola Walnut Salad. So satisfying!!!
The dressing is a citrus dressing and its amazing, so good you can drink it!  Great for vegetarians & meat eaters. Oh, and you can purchase the salad dressing for less than $4 a bottle! 

The have a great sandwich w/chicken, onions, peppers w/melted cheese that is TO DIE for! 

Everything is delish. I highly, highly recommend it. 

But one of the most simple things they have that really made me fall in love w/the place is their cupcakes, it is a white cake, with chocolate frosting. I normaly hate frosting, but I LOVE theirs! The cake is sweet, but NOT too sweet, and the frosting is very chocolaty but w/out making you go into a diabetic seizure!

Inside it was nice and warm and the service was friendly as my order was taken. I ordered the Threesome which is a Blonde, a Brunette and myself. In actuality, a half sandwich, soup and salad. For the sandwich, I had a Black Forest Ham with Swiss cheese. It was good sized and the meat was topped with fresh lettuce and a juicy tomato slice. The sourdough bread was tasty. They had two choices of soup that day. Of the two, I had the Beef Stew. It was very good. It warmed up my insides as the outdoor heater warmed up my outsides. 
The Ceasar salad tasted a little off at first. I don't know if the contrasting flavors of the soup and then the salad had anything to do with it. I ate it all anyways. It looked fresh enough and had a lot of cheese on it. 
I finished my meal and sat and listened to the musicians for awhile. It was a nice laid back atmosphere and a beautiful night to do so. 
I'd recommend dining here.",2009-11-01 17:57:43

Receiving 5 stars from me is preeetty difficult. You'd  have to hit everything: ambiance/atmosphere, superb food, decadent dessert, good service, perfectly priced. On top of that, it's a place that wants you coming back for more because there just isn't any other alternative out there - originality. Fresco hits all of Kathy's 5 star criteria.  BOMB ASS CAFE.

I've never had any complaints coming to Fresco.  They are always consistent and everything is pretty much wonderful.  It's a simple, low key, sophisticated cafe with a lot of GREAT FOOD.

Pros:
- Lots of parking
- Lots of variety in food
- All yummy fresh quality tasting 

Cons: 
- Gets crowded on nice warm days
- Limited patio/shade seating

Recommendations:
- Chinese Chicken Salad
- BIG YELLOW CUPCAKE WITH CHOCOLATE FLUFFY FROSTING. (OH MY GOD. IT IS SO AMAZING. NO JOKE. IT'S BETTER THAN ANY STORE SPECIALIZING IN CUPCAKES!) 
- Elcairs
- Fruit Tart 
- Basically try all of their desserts! :)",2009-11-10 22:01:56

High ceilings inside were appealing. Nice crowd. The place is busy and has a solid reputation. Unfortunately for me, I ordered the Greek salad. The feta was first-class and so was the dressing, but the salad was overloaded with red and yellow peppers. I could hardly find the tomatoes or cucumbers. The olives were tasty. I couldn't wade through all the peppers and it was disappointing. I still give the place high marks because everyone else enjoyed their food.

If someone were to go out into a thriving garden overflowing with scrumptious veggies and then still only hand pick the ones perfect at that moment...that's what I had. The salad then incorporated pistachio nuts and sunflowers seeds and topped it all with an olive oil balsamic dressing and shaved parm. Amazing. I washed it all down with a mix of their home brewed iced tea and lemonade...free refills! Take this story and add the Santa Barbara sunshine and you have yourself a damn good meal.

I didn't hate it, however I ordered a Caesar salad in a cafe so I won't try to pass judgment on the soups or sandwiches I did not try. The atmosphere bustles with an older slightly, sophisticated and rushed, sleepy looking crowd. My daughter ordered up a slab of pork ribs and although I didn't try them she assured me they were heavenly. They told us it was a lot of ribs for a kid to finish but she made it through the 8-10 ribs and on to her french fries. Those fries, I will say, were deliciously evil and I ate more than I plan to admit to publicly. 

Your order number is painted on a wooden baking spoon and propped up at your table. The waitresses seemed to have a little trouble spotting them amid the crowd but the food came up quickly and was still hot. The water is a self-serve station near the kitchen. Most tables sat two people, some sat 4, but with the crowd gathering in the late afternoon I wouldn't recommend bringing in a group.

For a large salad, (no meat, ya know!) and a plate of pig parts I paid way over $20. (we had water to drink) TOO MUCH for what it was. I got the feeling these things we ate were Costco style bulk frozen foods, BBQ sauce included. Tasty, as most Costco items are, but cheap.",2012-03-20 20:43:29

Everyone wants "" home made "" pies and pastries for dessert. And none of you want to wait too long for your meal. 

It's ok! You're at Fresco. 

Large menu for a variety of tastes. Lots of parking. Indoor or outdoor seating. Dog friendly patio (assuming your dog is nicely behaved, of course). 

Ordering your meal on the way to your table speeds service. The friendly staff take it from there.

Known especially for pasta, wraps and big yummy salads, you can also find pizza, burgers and club sandwiches. Soups and daily specials are worth checking out.  Always a few vegetarian choices, sometimes vegan choices as well. 

Some dishes are good, some very good.  In all the years of taking my friends there, no meal was ever deemed less than ""good"".  The food is incredibly consistent. 

The pastries, made by an Italian pastry chef, are delightful... rustic and filling. You will want to sample a few. 

The summer evenings might include live jazz or flamenco guitar.  Often you may see happy couples sitting on the patio, sipping wine, or people stopping by for dessert and coffee.

My husband brought the rest of his sandwich home (which was so good) as well as the rest of the girls' chicken tenders. I had the ravioli pasta meal and I ate all of it. I wish there had been more of it, it was just so good! All of the food we ate was so fresh and so good. I then went back and got a chocolate mousse. $5.50 and well worth the price. I got it to go and just ate it after we got home. I am so glad that I got it. The only down side in all of this is how far away we live from this restaurant. I can not say enough good things about this establishment. I look forward to the next time we visit Santa Barbara so we can visit Fresco Cafe again. We found it through Yelp and we were not disappointed. Trust me, you won't be either. Yes it's on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for and more. If you want something delicious, Fresco Cafe is the place to go! Thanks for the good time and great food Fresco Cafe!!",2017-03-23 21:59:04

The french dip is ok.  I am a french dip snob and this does not make my list of great French dips, but don't take that to heart because I haven't found a single French dip in Santa Barbara that would make my list of great French dips.  You'd have to travel to Georgia for that (order one at The Vortex and The Highlander to experience a French dip done right).  I'm open to recommendations though!  Seriously, if there is French dip on the menu I will most likely order it because I am on the hunt for a French dip that will make me go home and think about it and call my friends up and tell them about it like ""Oooh girrrl let me tell you about this French Dip I had...""

This location has a big, mostly covered patio with lots of tables. You order inside and then they bring out your food and clear your plates. 

At the other location I wasn't very impressed with the caprese sandwich or the garden salad, but this time I got a slice of margherita pizza with the gorgonzola walnut salad ($1 extra for the special salad) and man was it tasty. The pizza slice is large and the salad is also a good size with lots of gorgonzola and walnuts. I also stole a few fries (fresh cut, by the way) and a bite of the veggie burger, and both were tasty. The veggie burger comes on a soft brioche bun with the works--avocado, cheese, tomato, etc. etc.--at no extra charge. If you ask for water they give you cups with ice and you fill up yourself.

Overall I think this is a great place to get a lunch on the healthier side. Everything here seems very fresh and homemade. I wonder if they make the breads/buns in-house? Anyway, they also have lots of vegetarian options to choose from and the desserts looked tempting.

Come in the evenings when there's usually some jazzy little ensemble outside playing music. Despite being in a little shopping plaza along with Ross and Albertsons and the like, the atmosphere in this little corner is excellent and definitely feels a lot fancier than you'd think for the location. I liked taking dates here.

Food changes daily so there's plenty of variety and it always tastes fresh as well as has this grandmother-y, home-cooked essence. I use to work across the street at the Starbucks a long time back and knew a few of the workers at Fresco's. We'd trade frappacinos for soups and such and it was one of the best perks of working at that Starbucks. Try a little of everything as I've never had anything bad here but my personal favorites were the calzones and the creamed corn soup.

The one thing that really, really, really sucks about Fresco's though: it's closed on Sundays, which seem like the best day to have this kinda food. Always annoyed the heck outta me, haha.",2010-06-26 04:30:40

First we went to the Natural Cafe but there weren't any three=person tables, and I didn't want to be crowded, so Stan suggested Fresco.  I had not been there since 1998 and didn't remember how it was, but remembered good things basically.

It was a very large, nice, spacious room we sat in, lots of light, comfortable, not crowded with people up my ass, which I liked.

Now, I gave up eating red meat about 35 years ago, but I am moving through a health crisis and the doctor said red meat would be good for me, besides, I grew up on hamburgers and fries, it's a deep primal part of me, so I decided on the Angus Burger with fries, and chose Gruyere cheese, on a 9=grain bun.

IT WAS THE BEST HAMBURGER i HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

And that's saying something, because I grew up eating burgers almost every day.  The bun was perfect, cheese perfect, burger perfectly cooked, the fries outstanding.......the meal still resonates with me two days later as a happy memory....I'm only sorry I was with other people, so I had to speak with them, when I had much rather just eat my burger.

I later congratulated the men in the grill, but my Spanish is pretty crappy so I don't know if they know how much I appreciated their cooking, but it was amazing.

Now I know why Fresco has had such a great rep all these years.

I will go back and have another Angus Burger soon, but this time I will go alone so I can concentrate on my burger.

It's rare for me to have a meal so good that the memory stays with me. 

Thanks Fresco!",2012-03-23 04:34:37

I always get the Turkey Triple Decker with Gorgonzola walnut salad. I am usually not a sandwich person or a salad person, but oh my god, I LOVE, LOVE these two dishes from here. I think it is the dressing that makes the salad soooo amazing. I always ask for extra dressing so I could dip my sandwich in it. 

Another dish that I highly recommend is the Ahi Seared Salad. The Ahi is seared to perfection! It is never too dry and the dressing is very light and flavorful. 

At the beginning of each quarter, I always stock up on the coupon books that you can get from UCSB's bookstore. All you have to do is get an entree-- which starts as low as their $5 soup-- and you can get a free dessert worth $5!

Don't let me even begin to describe how AMAZING, DECADENT, and SAVORY their desserts are! They have the best dessert selection which makes every trip so rewarding. My favorite desserts are their tiramisu, chocolate ganache, and fruit tart. 

My girlfriends and co-workers and I go here every chance we get when I was in Santa Barbara. My roommate/best friend/co-worker would literally dine here for hours at a time gossiping, catching up on things, and just embracing the warm atmosphere.

I usually get the tuna salad over mixed greens, which is fantastic.  They make a killer tuna salad (it is almost as good as Genova's in Oakland and that's a tough place to match).  My partner goes for the Turkey burger and is always very happy.

The pasta specials are very delicious as well. The meatball sandwich is probably the best in town, except they over-toast the rolls a bit so it gets messy.

Unfortunately the ticket had been lost and there was no food on its way, but we were lucky enough to be there when the owner(s) were there.  I, being the grumpy, hungry husband wanted to take my money and split, but my wife - and the voice of reason - suggested we stay.  The owners - and subsequently the other employees who helped us straighten things out - were sincerely apologetic and as soon as they understood the problem they set us a new table and had our food out to us in about 2 minutes flat.

Customer service definitely A++ and kept me as a loyal customer.",2012-04-28 05:00:52

I prefer Fresco for lunch over dinner. Fresco uses a modified fast casual approach where you order at the counter and refill your own ice tea. But the food is served to you table side. Because of this Fresco has a very casual feel. The seating is really nice outside with comfortable chairs and plenty of tables in the shade. Yet the inside feels tight and not as inviting. This is why, in my opinion Fresco is a better choice for lunch than dinner! 

In terms of pricing you pay a little more dinning at Fresco than a chain Sandwitch or Salad place, but it makes sense, the quality and freshness, the handmade dishes and local feel.   

Fresco is a true locals favorite and should not be missed.",2018-08-03 03:11:56

Let it be known: I love this place. Everything about it: (Well, almost everything; parking is maddeningly difficult to find at this particular location.)
+The fresh ingredients
+The bright and cheery vibe
+The excellent choices
+The (Santa Barbara)-fair prices
+The insanely delicious desserts
+Even their always-clean restroom

I've tried (and truly enjoyed) almost every item on their menu. Some of my favorites:
+Caesar salad: romaine lettuce with house-made Caesar dressing, Parmesan cheese, and homemade croutons. Pretty standard, but just SO good.
+Gorgonzola walnut salad: mixed greens with a citrus balsamic vinaigrette dressing, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts, and diced tomatoes. Truly hits the spot when you're craving a good, hearty salad.
+Seared Ahi tuna sandwich: seared Ahi steak with lettuce, tomato, onion, on a sesame roll. I could eat only this for days. I think I might have, too.

If you're eying the desserts, do yourself a favor and get something. My recommendations:
+Flourless chocolate cake: perfect for when you *need* chocolate.
+Vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting: Moist, creamy, and all the other perverted adjectives you can think of.
+Apple pie: mile-high and super apple-y.

v7C61vLUzd7Hc59sWacEpw,W83aZrDrYKwycCHB_eOYYg,1kVnChI4aqsPw9i2PVqkkw,5,3,0,0,"I went to Fresco the first month or so I lived in SB, 1996 September I liked it but didn't come all that much because I kind of hate Five Points and this is not an area of town I particularly like. 

But I started to come back semi-regularly when I started dating my boyfriend because it's a perfect kid place: grown-ups can eat top notch food at reasonable prices (no table service: you order at counter and food runner brings you meal /wine) and kids can find something they will enjoy. 

There is no corkage so you can bring a nice (15-20) bottle of wine and save money that way too. 

Parking is miserable but it's not as bad as Trader Joe's two lots (the worst in SB). 

The prices are great and there is no bad dish. I recently had my grilled chicken sandwich with peppers and provolone on grilled sourdough and a Caesar (half-sandwich and soup or salad is called ""twosome"" and it's 9 or so even at night because they have an all-day menu). 

My boyfriend had a pasta with pork ragout and I was astonished by how good it was. 

Fresco also serves THE BEST tortilla soup I've ever tasted at any restaurant, even fancy fine dining Mexicans. 

The desserts are decadent and dangerous and my boyfriend adores the mixed berry pie. There are cakes, cupcakes, pies as well as panna cotta. 

It's a gem. And because there are no servers and it's in Five Points (where rent is lower than downtown but higher than Goleta), the prices are excellent. 

I love Fresco and must start going more often.

Know that if you come at 5:30-7PM it's kid city but the kids are pretty well-behaved and they don't impinge on your life in any significant way .If you eat later, you'll have a child-free environment. The booths are very comfortable but it's hard to get one at peak hours. At lunch, it's a work crowd, but even at its most crowded, those people hustle and the service is terrific. 

I cannot say enough for Fresco other than its location in Five Points.",2014-02-12 15:52:27
SmW8ux6Rn2G5yPISOpSpMQ,A4bsa7ykYRVCnb4h2vZALw,1kVnChI4aqsPw9i2PVqkkw,4,104,68,96,"As many times as I've been here it's about time I write a review! I've tried many items on the menu over the years and the one thing that I love about Fresco is how consistently fresh all the ingredients are. Especially when I order a salad the lettuce is never brown or wilted. My favorite has to be the Gorgonzola Walnut Salad. The candied walnuts make it extra special, the gorgonzola cheese is not too pungent, and the balsamic vinaigrette is perfectly made. You definitely must try this one!

This place is a bit more on the pricier side but they do offer some items on the menu that are budget friendly and they won't leave you hungry either. I usually go for their pizza slice specials ($9.95). The slice of pizza is a generous size and it comes with your choice of salad. The grilled shrimp & roasted tomato w/pesto sauce is topped with 3 huge juicy shrimps. When I first tried this I was thinking it would be topped with smaller sized shrimp but no complaints here as they were grilled perfectly and delicious. 

For the main dishes I've tried their chicken club sandwich, turkey burger, spicy chicken sandwich, grilled shrimp and salmon salad, and much more! All of which were delicious. Today I opted for the veggie burger on a brioche bun with brie cheese. The brie cheese was a little too salty so I would choose a different cheese next time, but the veggie burger was amazing! It's made from lentils, red pepper, celery, mushrooms, onions, garlic and other delicious healthy ingredients. Highly recommend you give this a try if you're looking for a healthier option and it won't leave you feeling bloated.

They are always busy during the noon lunch rush so if you're ever pressed for time then give them a call and order ahead of time. Indoor and Outdoor seating is provided for dine in.

Save room for dessert! There are so many delicious treats to choose from It's always a tough decision trying to figure out what to get but I highly recommend their ever so popular chocolate flourless cake. It's light, fluffy, and not overly sweet. They also offer gluten-free desserts. 

Overall Fresco has a broad menu and lots of yummy dishes to choose from. Give it a try if you are looking for a restaurant with a variety of options.",2017-09-22 21:51:49

They have lots of good sandwiches. The pizza still above average. The pasta is good. 

But I ordered the Chinese chicken salad and it was inedible: romaine lettuce with sesame vinegar and oil, plus dry, tasteless chicken and a few Mandarin oranges. Just horrible and for 14 bucks, totally worthless. 

I switched it out for the veggie burger---which was equally horrible (and which I'd never ordered before). A mushy bizarre patty on a brioche bun. The cheese and tomato were edible, but the rest of it went down the garbage disposal. 

I remember the chicken tortilla soup being good, but I could be thinking of another place in town I used to go years ago.

The ham inside the eggs were cooked with nice browning on the side and juicy insides. The eggs were soft and light. The toast was soft and puffy (not like the thin toasts you get in other places) with some burnt edges. Some people may not like the burnt edges, but I thought they were fine. The butter had just the right balance of hardness and softness. The butter was hard enough that it was actually butter, and not some creamy margarine. Yet, it was just creamy enough that it spread perfectly on the toast. The blueberry jam was my favorite! It tasted fresh and sweet and had none of that tart flavor.

It would just hit me like a ton of bricks later if they weren't.  The cookies have the right consistency.  The cakes are tender and melt in your mouth.  The frostings are delectable.  I had a turkey club sandwich with actual bread - The bread, the meat, the avocado all meted in my mouth and the crispy bacon - I mean yum.  Their gluten-free bread is literally the greatest thing since sliced bread.  The Chocolate Decadence cake is highly recommended, and unless you have two stomachs, you will need to share it or take it home. mmmmmm...  I have mine for later.

I came to gluten free by accident.  A good friend applied gentle pressure and I thought what the heck?  Surely in a month, I thought I'd be writing ""I heart gluten"" on my Facebook page.  And then my husband and I made couscous.  I woke up feeling drunk the next day.  And then it hit me, there were times I woke feeling that same way after having a couple of beers or even1 beer.  I wasn't hung over from the alcohol.  It was a wheat hangover.  OMG.  I was gluten intolerant!  Who'd a thunk it?  Thanks to places like this, it's getting easier to deal with this wacky dietary restriction.

The lilac and white walls make for a soothing environment.  They keep it very clean.  I was impressed.  In any case, I am so totally going back.  The staff there were really generous with their time and kind to everyone while I was there.  But their black bean & rice soup need some serious help as it was really bland.  It needs some beef stock and chipotle - or at least chipotle.

I do want to drop them a star for not having any signage at their back entrance indicating they are open or closed and leaving the door open.  I walked in there on a Monday not realizing they were closed and the people there were completely rude to me about it.  What the heck?  I'm a newish customer and I don't have your hours memorized.

Most disappoint. Not Lilac. 
On my first visit, I cheated. I bought a banana tart and a peanut butter cookie. Not really a test of gluten free. 
The cookie was good, but unsurprising. PB cookies don't need gluten, IME. 
The tart was beautiful, garnished with chocolate. And very tasty, not overly sweet, more banana than custard. The crust was crispy, with a mild flavour that supported the filling without competing. 
The second visit, I had a chocolate raspberry cake. Thin layers of chocolate cake with thin layers of chocolate raspberry filling covered by a thick chocolate ganache. The cake was very moist and very tasty. 
I was offered a mini cupcake and accepted only because I wanted the opportunity to try their cake with less moisture. 
Would have never known it was gluten free. More on the muffin side than the cake side, but good. 
If they did not label as gluten-free, I would never know. 
The only thing that was other than I would have wished is the hot chocolate. Not that it wasn't good, but I prefer rich, dark chocolate.

Arrived 15 minutes before closing and thankfully several cakes were still available (might have been the whole selection?). Came on a full stomach so my friend and I decided to just split one and picked a slice of the popular Berry Patch cake. Honestly, not the biggest fan of cream, so I had my reservations. 

Consensus - amazing. Cake was so moist, fruit was fresh and sweet, cream was light and not heavy at all. Combination is done frequently but never before have I been a fan of it except for this cake. So good we decided to order another one and a princess slice to take home. 

Tried the princess slice the next morning with my family (kept it refrigerated) and was just as good. Marzipan layer on top added the proper sweetness to the less sweet interior (as this cake has no fruit - just cream). 

Staff was kind and helpful and even though the store closed already, they didn't rush us at all.

Everything is gluten free, for those who are sensitive to gluten.  As one for whom that doesn't matter, I could not tell the difference at all.

They certainly aren't sugar free, so keep that in mind!  Walking in to the clean, white space, your eyes are drawn to the display cases where the cakes are kept cool.  Many feature cream fillings or whipped toppings, so much be kept refrigerated.

I was drawn to both the Princess Torte and the Berry Patch Cake.  I intended to order a slice of the latter, but mis-spoke and ended up with the Princess Torte.  Extremely rich and delicious.  I had about a third of it and brought the rest home.  At $8 a slice, I was skeptical that it would be worth it, but clearly, with the richness factor and a size large enough to share, it held its value well.

I'd suggested that we share whatever we chose, but DH preferred a piece of pie versus cake.  He chose the pear-ginger pie and thoroughly enjoyed it.  He also ordered a caramel latte.  Very rich, European flavor on the coffee.

We sat outside at their petite bistro tables bordering State, watching the tourists pass by.  Perfect sweet treat on many levels.",2016-07-10 19:35:03

Recalling the disappointing limited GF options of decades past and my own baking mediocrity with gluten free flours, I am always in awe of bakeries that do it well. And Lilac Pâtisserie does it extremely well. 

Once you fully comprehend that all of those gorgeously decorated cakes are totally available to you, along with every other sweet and savory item there, you then are faced with the most difficult task of choosing. There is truly something for everyone; vegan, vegetarian and omnivores.  

We began with the breakfast sandwich that induces salivation just thinking about it. It was a colorful presentation of thick slices of toasted GF bread of your choice (we chose the brioche), perfectly sized slices of ham and cheddar cheese, a stack of fresh greens, and a generous slathering of fresh pesto all bathed in the slightly oozy yolks of perfectly fried eggs. Amazing Yum! 

We decided on a few items for later sampling and a couple of those stand out. The Key Lime Tart had a flaky crust and beautiful custard that was perfectly citrus-y and not overly sweet. Sour Cream Coffee Cake has a buttery, moist crumb and is also not too sweet (think these might be even more lovely directly out of the oven) The large house-made Rosemary Bread loaf made beautiful sandwiches and breakfast toast for days. Lastly, all the cookies we tried (Linzertortes, Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter, Toffee Nut and Florentines) were perfect, even the next day. Looking forward to trying a slice of cake on a future visit.

The counter staff was cheerful and very helpful. Their suggestions were spot on as to what we thought we were looking for and they were very knowledgeable with all three menus (breakfast, lunch, and bakery/cakes). Takeaway items were packaged well and survived hours of driving on the backseat of an automobile.

Many I had tried tasted like this wonderfully delicious Play-Dough, which I became really addicted to for a time. But, even Play-Dough coconut cake, Play-Dough chocolate cake, and Play-Dough vanilla cake needs a break once in a while. Not so with Lilac ~ You would never ever know that the cakes are gluten-free, ever. Everything tastes distinctly as described.The chocolate mousse filling is dense, the cake is moist and not too airy. But the marzipan, oh, Heaven on Earth, thank you, thank you, thank you. I must preface this by saying that, typically, we scoop out the cake and buttercream/ roll back the marzipan and leave it on the plate. However, the almond-flavored marzipan on the Princess torte tasted like it was just made and rolled out ~ and with the best quality almond flavoring on the planet. Who knew?!  The torte is a vanilla cake with a raspberry & vanilla cream filling The chocolate decadence Cake was the best we've ever had. Rich, dense, chocolate filling, moist cake, fresh choco-buttercream, sinful dark chocolate curls fluttering on top. 

Great staff - graciously attentive. Squeakily pretty and clean environment. Lots of happy people dining around us. We'll definitely be regulars. Oh, and the portions are HUGE. We had two slices and they lasted for a total of 4 servings for the 2 of us. Check out our photos.    

PS: we are constantly looking for a bakery that stays open late, an ""Insomnia Bakery."" We hope Lilac considers this, maybe one night a week?",2015-03-09 07:57:36

The pastries are always tasty.  I truly love that sour cream coffeecake.

We both had such a delicious breakfast our first time here, that we returned the following weekend for breakfast. Our first visit I had the omelette, while my DH had the scrambled egg breakfast.  This last visit we decided to order two breakfasts and split them.  We ordered the omelette and the breakfast sandwich.  Oh my gosh....the breakfast sandwich is the most delicious I have ever tasted!!!  The arugula and pesto gave it so much flavor, and the ham used in this sandwich was the best ever.  We both love the white toast that we've ordered with the apricot jelly.  The sandwich also came on this same toast.  All we can say is yum!  And this big plus is it is gluten free!  The case of sweets....cupcakes, cakes, and breads look absolutely yummy.  We will definitely be back for breakfast, and now can't wait to try their lunch.

Lilac Patisserie is a wonderful find on State Street that first lures a person in with the shop sign.  A very quaint, charming sign, and once you peer in the window, you see a couple of display cases full of gorgeous cakes, not to mention a shop full of satisfied looking customers eating lunch and/or dessert.  The marketing is slick....... you have to stand in line to order, but as you stand in line, you are forced to pass by the gorgeous cakes, and if you can pass by them (and the other delectable sweet treats) without ordering any, well, something is very wrong with you.  No, just kidding........ but the cakes are absolutely gorgeous, and it was impossible not to order something.

And then we tasted them.  My husband ordered the lemon raspberry cake, and I ordered the bananas foster cake.  WOW !!  They taste as wonderful as they look.  First of all, ALL CAKES ARE GLUTEN FREE, and while that is not at issue for me, it's still nice to know for those who do need to pay attention to that, and the taste/texture is not the least bit compromised for it.  The cake that I ordered was covered in whipped cream, and for the first time ever, I actually loved it.  It was a heavier whipped cream, lightly flavored, but its texture, I don't know, it was just different.  And better....MUCH better.  As for the cakes, I noticed they weren't as sweet as I was expecting them to be, and neither of us went into a sugar coma from eating them, either.  

The lemon raspberry cake was a yellow butter cake (again, gluten free), with layers of raspberry preserves and lemon curd and frosted with a lemon buttercream.  It was light and flavorful.  The bananas foster cake, which I ordered, was a banana cake brushed with rum and filled with layers of caramel, whipped cream and sliced bananas, and then frosted with whipped cream.  Bananas can be quite overpowering with their flavor, but not with this cake.  It was very moist, tasty, but not over-bearing with its banana flavor.  Honestly, I can't say I tasted the rum or the caramel, but the end result was delicious and moist.  I really enjoyed it.

I even texted my daughter that this would make a great choice for her future wedding cake, and she (meaning I) should keep it in mind.  She's not even engaged, but a mom can hope, right?

The french toast was amazing! It wasn't overly sweet, and the bread had a nice zesty, citrusy flavor that brightened up the whole dish, along with the fresh fruits! At ~$12, the prices were great!

We also ordered coffee- I got the mocha and my friend got a vanilla latte. Honestly, the coffee was nothing special and way too overpriced in my opinion (~$5.50) for what we actually got. [They charge an extra dollar for flavorings].

We also took a slice of New York cheesecake to-go, and it was exquisite! It was super pricy, at $8.50 but it was so good and you could totally split it!

My first instinct was to skip lunch and just order a ton of dessert, but after looking at their menu I decided I should do both! My husband and I both got turkey sandwiches, and it was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! The bread was so fresh and tasted like pure heaven when I ate it! The rest of the ingredients tasted great and very fresh! No idea what they did to make the sandwiches so delicious but I was very impressed! My husband also got a soup and it was spectacular! 

Finally the time came for the desserts!!! We ordered a pot of hot chocolate, only this is not your regular hot coco, this is something beyond words! It's melted chocolate ganache in a liquid form and as you drink it you might think you are in chocolate heaven! The thought of it makes my mouth water even now!! The cake and tart we ordered didn't disappoint!! They tasted just as good as they looked!! Every spoonful of the cake and tart hits your taste buds with an overwhelming taste of pure joy!!

The storefront is super cute with all their delicious cakes on display. There's some nice seating in the store and the ambiance reminded me of a small, elegant European cafe. Being 3 pm on a Wednesday, there weren't too many people hanging out, but I would totally come back and catch up with a friend here!

Service was quick and friendly, as I asked the cashier for her recommendation. Based on this, I ordered a slice of the berry cake, plus three cookies (what can I say, I already told you I love sweets!).

I didn't eat the cake until the next day, so I can't comment on how it would taste fresh. However, even a day old it was perfectly light and fluffy. Each bite felt like a sugary cloud and I never wanted to stop. Paired with a cup of tea, it made me feel like I was back in the cute cafe.

But honestly, the food is amazing regardless--even if you can handle gluten, you should check this place out. My husband (who can eat gluten) and I were in Santa Barbara for a few days and made several trips here. We had:

--Strawberry cheesecake: perfect balance of strawberry and excellent texture
--Lemon cheesecake: better than the strawberry. I am blown away by how well they have the texture down. This is exactly how cheesecake should be. 
--Quiche: super creamy and again, excellent texture. Excellent crust too. 
--Citrus beet salad: my one complaint is that I got this salad to-go and they forgot to give me a roll. The salad had lots of beets and oranges. I ordered it without dressing and it was excellent--the moisture from the oranges was all it needed
--Turkey club: tasty sandwich. The BREAD here is AMAZING. It tastes delicious and holds up in a sandwich. I got this to-go, and the bread wasn't soggy even after a few hours. 
--Avocado toast: get it. Do it. So good. The alfalfa works perfectly with the smashed tomato and avocado. 
--Cookies: peanut butter and chocolate chip were soft and perfect
--Chocolate cherry scone: the most scone-like gluten-free scone I've found (and believe me, I search!)
--Coffee cake: probably not their strongest item, but still really good.

The interior is inviting and most synonymous with a French/Italian bakery. The employees were especially friendly, while also patiently waiting while I made up my mind! There were way too many gluten-free goodies available, and I wanted one of everything!

The vegan, gluten-free carrot cupcake was the best carrot cake treat I've ever had! I'm a carrot cake snob, and everything about this little mountain of heaven was divine! The frosting was rich, creamy, and tasted anything but vegan! The cake interior was airy, moist, and filled with fresh carrots and dried fruit! The frosting/cake ratio was spot on, and the sweetness level was just right. I have no clue how they make such a great gluten-free cake, but I'm sure glad I stopped in!

Shout out to Fransisco for his hospitality-- he went around to every table and checked in with customers! It's refreshing to have such personalized and genuine service. Good thing I was not on my way home, as I probably would have stocked up on an insane amount of pastries!

The quiche is savory and flakey with a lovely thick filling. I recommend sharing it for sure, if only to have room for other things as well.

The tarte consists of perfectly ripe fruit thinly sliced and arranged in lovely patterns over a light, creamy filling. The crust is a perfect short crust with just the right touch of sweetness to compliment the beautiful fillings. The combination of textures is a perfect balance.

Lastly, the French Toast. While a little on the dry side, the flavor is unique and lovely with distinct orange overtones. There is a VERY subtle flavor of cardamom or fennel (we couldn't identify which), a perfect touch for those intense flavors.",2019-02-16 19:32:08

I was visiting Santa Barbara for the day, and with a little extra time to kill, looked into my Yelp bookmarks and found this place was nearby. Holy smokes, it was a great last-minute not-even-planned discovery! Every gluten free pastry, cake, or baked good you could ever want (and can't figure out how to make yourself at home) can be found here. I got a few staple items: lemon bar, fruit tarte, cheesecake, and coffee cake; and the verdict? It's way better than any gluten free bakery I've found thus far in LA. And, I dare say, it's the best gluten free bakery I've come across in the U.S.! Bonus: it's 100% gluten free so no need to worry about cross contamination! The gluten free cheesecake was a tad too cheesy, not enough ""cakey"" for my liking, but everything else blew me away. The cinnamon roll was so good -- especially when warmed up in the microwave at home! It tasted more real and fresh than other versions I've tried. The fruit tarte was a little weird with thinly sliced mango on top, but aside from the topping, the tarte itself was spot-on for what I remember tartes tasting like in my pre-gluten-free days. Even the lemon bar, a pretty simple item, was way better than lemon bars I've had elsewhere. 

Living in LA, I'm at least an hour and a half away from here, but you can bet I'll be back soon to try more. There were multiple different flavors of cheesecake you can buy by the slice and even cakes by the slice too! I'm not used to having so many choices when limited to a gluten free diet. I even grabbed their gluten free cake menu and I'm already trying to decide which one to order for my birthday!

So, since I'm a last-minute, about-to-leave-for-the-party kinda gal, I keep winding up paying top dollar to buy cakes here. Last year, it was an $80+ dark chocolate cake with gold foil. That was such a damn good cake, that the memories of it have me sitting here with drool sliding down my chin.

This year, I got the small princess torte, because: 1) the Yelp reviewers rave about the taste, and 2) it's extraordinarily pretty - the perfect confection to take to a garden party, with its spring green marzipan topping and gorgeous buttercream roses. So, so pretty.

So, yeah, I bought the little one and some $1.50 candles they sell, and shoved them into the cake and headed to IV for a birthday party.

When I arrived, Birthday Boy and the Gang were knee deep in peanut butter stout. But when they saw that glowing princess torte, they perked up and dove in!

One small princess torte bridged the gap between 8 inebriated college students and 2 tired parents. There was plenty to go around and even a leftover piece, which I heard Birthday Boy was last seen using as a face mask.

My birthday is in 3 months and dammit, this cake is gonna be mine!

I ordered the daily soup special (chili) and a slice of chocolate-strawberry cake (it was National Chocolate Cake day apparently). The chili was a generous portion and beautifully presented.

I only wish there was not as much fondant on it and rather more buttercream, though that is a personal preference.

I went on a Sunday afternoon (around 1pm) with a friend to get some writing done and the place was still busy. I had asked one of the staff if they minded if we squatted for a few hours (granted - I had made two purchases by this point in time) and he was very understanding.

Be sure to give it at least 30 minutes and ideally closer to 1+ hours to come to temperature as warming up made a drastic difference in the texture and flavors.

Case in point, the cake served cold was underwhelming with its clumped buttercream and dry, grainy cake.  Adequately warmed up, the sea salt buttercream provided a great balance of soft sweetness and saltiness and pulled the yellow cake, whipped pastry cream and Belgian chocolate ganache together nicely.  My one knock was that the cake itself was still on the dry, grainy side.

Overall, a solid cake that was just a bit more style than substance.  At $60 for a 6"", it was admittedly way overpriced.",2020-09-29 00:17:28

Environment: Adorable inside layout with black and white theme, fresh flowers on the table, and modern style decor; great for Instagram pics. Their are large glass windows that look out on State St, but also seating further inside to where you're not distracted by the foot traffic if you prefer not to be. There is a really cute, secret back patio (which you can enter the cafe through the public parking lot next to the bus station on Chapala). It's filled with greenery, succulent magic, umbrellas, and more. I would recommend the patio on a nice day and indoor seating with a latte and muffin on a rainy day setting. 

Staff: Kind hearted, very bubbly, and knowledgable on their products. I've done a few special orders for baked goods here. Calling in here is just as easy to order as being in person. They make the process quick and any time I've come back for pick up my items for ready on time and just what I ordered.

Baked Goods: For health reasons I've been baking my own GF and Vegan goods for about 8 years now so I know the ins and outs of what tastes too mushy, grainy, dry, sweet, etc. Though the cupcakes here are stunning in their appearance, I've always found them to be a little too grainy for my liking. The carrot cake, is best of all of them though because it has things in it to distract you from the cake texture. However, the vegan cream cheese frosting isn't something I'd recommend either due to it's odd salty taste - the consistency is nice though! 

Overall I would love to love this place because the staff are awesome, I respect any business pulling off the full gluten free menu, and the environment is so darn cute! The prices are just so high for a meal, which is why I have yet to try the food, and the baked goods aren't the best I've had.

Berry patch cake ($8.00): white cake sandwiched in fresh berries and light icing. Similar to the berry cake from Sweet Lady Jane in Santa Monica, the cake was not too sweet, moist, and slightly crumbly. 

Cappuccino ($4.00): not too bad. 

Ham and cheese scone ($3.75): it was crispy, semi chewy and topped with melted cheese. Served warmed up, the scone was not dry like your typical scone. 

The bakery is so clean and cute. The workers were friendly, helpful and happy. The customers seemed to be happy too.

Maybe a few would get to three stars if you were giving them credit for being gluten-free, and once in a blue moon you would get a four-star gluten-free experience, which would translate to ""when I ate this I didn't want to cry over my gluten intolerance"".

But as someone who tries to limit my gluten, rather than someone who truly can't tolerate it, I have pretty much given up on gluten-free baking -- I'd rather generally live without baked goods, and then ""splurge"" by occasionally eating actually good baked goods full of that good, good, gluten-y goodness. Because why eat something that tastes like chalk?

Lilac changed my mind. This isn't ""good for gluten-free"" -- it's just actually SOOOO good. I ate a coffee cake that was moist, flavorfull, and arguably enough for two but it was so tasty I wolfed it down. It was so delicious I would have SWORN it was chock full of refined wheat flour, but nosiree Bob, this is the real gluten-free deal. Either that or this place is run by evil geniuses who have figured out that you can make AMAZING baked goods and just label them gluten-free. 

But there was just the slightest chalky aftertaste which convinced me it really was gluten-free....and that aftertaste didn't detract from the taste at all, because I didn't notice it until I was all done. And it was probably just the taste of longing for more.",2016-07-16 22:16:46

The sandwich was served on warm olive bread and the quinoa and spring salad mix was the perfect side. The lemon bar was tiny. The portions are itty bitty but hey, I'm on a diet so that works out. The desserts aren't spectacular, it's kind of bland for what one can do these days. 

The second time I returned a week later, imagine my disappointment to see that things went downhill a bit, they didn't offer olive bread anymore, but instead provided a stale tasting sandwich. The blueberry lemon tart didn't have any lemon (and they needed some tartness to balance out the raw blueberries). Imagine biting into a tasteless sponge with raw blueberries on top sprinkled with powdered sugar. Not hot. 

I guess I was expecting more for a patisserie that's rated 10th in the entire country. America either has terrible patisseries, or this place was a bit too hyped for what it is. That said, it is a quaint place to relax and it feels like one walked into a European storefront. I enjoy the ambiance while pretending I'm eating European quality food.

I just had my wedding in SB on the 10th and had my cake ordered from Lilac. It was 4 tiers of beauty and deliciousness! I also ordered chocolate dipper strawberries decorated as bride/groom.

First, the cake: 
Tier 1 = red velvet - this was amazing in how moist and light it felt, while still achieving the richness of a red velvet taste.
Tier 2 = chocolate almond praline - this was the chocolate that everyone needs in their life. Smooth/rich layers of chocolate and the almond give it the perfect balance for crunch.
Tier 3 = German chocolate = I'm simply going to say that this tier tasted like an almond joy. It was that instant feel of coconut with chocolatey richness.
Tier 4 = red velvet = can't go wrong with this repeat. 

Now the strawberries:
They were gorgeous and huge! The milk chocolate of the groom strawberries and the white chocolate of the bride strawberries were a huge hit with everyone there!

The decoration:
The cake was gorgeous and literally created as planned. No interpretations, no surprises. What you want is literally what you get - the same with the strawberries.

The overall experience: 
If you order for a major event you will work with Gillian - the owner. She is such a delight to work with. She was kind and generous with the cake tasting (you should do this - full pieces - so worth it). And, everything else that followed was meticulous and beyond organized. This patisserie goes beyond helpful and very reasonable with pricing! 

A wedding party of 80 - loved what they ate and couldn't stop complimenting. Some guests even started stealing each other strawberries (even though we had plenty!). My husband and I came home with at least 20 strawberries and have been enjoying the extra's!

The decor is simple, bright, and minimalist which I love. We came on a Saturday 2/13 before Valentine's Day and they were really busy. However, the line moved quickly. When we got to the register to order, I think it was the owner or chef who rang us up. She was so adorable and sweet. I complimented her cakes (especially the Valentine's Day one) and she was so happy and said she made them herself. I love that she had so much pride in her product. Tbh the pastries, cakes and really everything was a little pricey but after trying their pastries.... it's definitely worth the price. I would be happy to pay higher prices for quality products and superior service. Everyone who worked there was friendly and unfrazzoled even when they had a long line out the door. We had the coffee cakes, lemon cheesecake and a blueberry muffin. We saved the coffee cakes to take home the next day. Let me tell you.... the lemon cheesecake and the blueberry muffin was the best I've ever had. I have no idea how they do it but it does NOT taste gluten free at all. It's amazing.

Found on Yelp as GF bakery & think I remember them from a GF expo years ago so had to pick up a sampling to bring home to my boy.  First, the bakery case is filled with beautiful options! If you're GF, it will feel impressive.  We are also soy-free and had no troubles finding lots of options.  Can't wait to go back next time in SB to have breakfast/brunch.  There was a very big crowd there with a 15 min line to order so certainly a a fav among locals.  Felt very fresh/upscale. Their berries & egg dishes coming out looked amazing. The staff was super nice (aside from the guy who checked me out - he was okay but a bit snarky).  We tried the berry cake (YES!), chocolate decadence cake (like a death by chocolate type cake), florentine cookies (my fav since childhood), linzertorte(?) cookies, chocolate chip cookie, cherry scone, & rosemary olive loaf.  Totally forgot to order the blueberry lemon tart and key lime tart as both looked pretty darn good.  Our favorites have been the berry cake and linzertorte cookies.  The berry cake reminds me of a wedding cake - light, whipped frosting, wonderfully fresh berries inside.  A slice runs approx $10 but it's a really really big slice.  In fact if I wanted a GF wedding cake, that would be the one!! The linzertorte cookies (about $2.50/ea) are kind of fun b/c they have a raspberry type jam in the middle with a cutout and powdered sugar sprinkle.  My child loved that one, I wasn't as sold on it but guess that's why there are options.  Was really surprised I didn't love the choc decadence cake more as I'm a huge choc fan.  Also a light cake with more of a butter cream type frosting and beautiful choc curl on top so if you're craving choc it's a good choice.  Think I wanted a little more dense cake portion, but really it was pretty good, attractive & shouldn't complain.  The choc chip cookie was fine - as expected and big.  I have been craving florentine cookies (about $2.75/ea) for years now so was super excited for those.  They were tasty w/an orange essence, but more like a light brittle as they were missing the chocolate dipped bottom.  Haven't tried the scone yet - breaky tomorrow.  The olive loaf was pretty good.  It's a really big loaf (around $12) of bread so thinking we will need to freeze at least half of it so it doesn't go bad.  

If you're in the area and are GF (or SF), definitely make the effort.  Give yourself enough time as it's popular.  Even if you aren't GF, would still recommend for fresh beautiful food.",2021-10-18 02:40:18

When I walked in I went over the moon!  The place is sparkling clean, spacious, very cool mod/vintage interior with a cake display and cookies, brownies, mini-cakes displays that magnetized me flat-faced into the glass!  Their goods are extraordinary!  They are gorgeous, of genius level combinations, tastes to fit every palate and delicious coffees and teas to accompany their treats. They have a cake decorator there who is such an amazing artist, she makes the cakes stunning pieces of art.

So of course, being gluten intolerant, I HAD to try their Chocolate Decadence cake--by the slice. When it arrived at the table with my soy latte, I could not believe the size of the ""slice"".  It was like an 1/8th of a cake.  With two of us chowing down on it, we could not finish it. So, naturally, the next day with my Nespresso espresso, I ate all the rest of it.

I cannot recommend this place enough, even if you aren't gluten intolerant.  The cake I ate was moist, rich, chocolatey, french creamery buttery, holding together without crumbling into tiny bits. I was impressed and wanting more. Feedback from my girl friend who took her two cakes to a birthday and welcome dinner where gluten-free is the standard, was they were ""blown away"".

The staff is over the top friendly, accommodating and intelligent, the ambiance refreshing. with a great view of State Street.

The baked goods I had are noticeably better than most bakeries, as well as being gluten free. 

I got the $14 ham and egg sandwich on olive bread (I'm a sucker for olive bread). I just assumed the bread wasn't made in house, but as soon as I saw it I knew. Ham was salty. Egg was of good quality. Another patron I saw while eating had a bread loaf to go. 

The sandwich came with some arugula and fruit (fresh) on the side. I think the arugula was added for looks because it was not made for easy consumption (a vinaigrette would have been nice).

The coffee is lux coffee, based out of LA/Malibu. I would recommend going to Lux instead of you want an espresso drink (it's way better there), but I imagine the drip coffee should be comparable for both. 

Since I figured I wouldn't be back for a while, I also got a slice of chocolate raspberry cake. It was well balanced for being chocolate on chocolate. The in between layers were chocolate mixed with raspberries. There was a hard chocolate outside that made it hard to keep the cake from collapsing on itself as you stab it.

The food arrived hot and was tasty but the bread was a little lackluster.

 I tried a slice of their carrot cake, which was a bit over sweet (as someone with a rampant sweet tooth) because the icing was more sugary buttercream than cream cheese (the tartness of cream cheese icing typically balances out the saccharine of the cake). The berry cake was lighter and well-balanced.

I live 90 minutes north, and I had no business strolling around Montecito until the day my girlfriend got a job there...right next to what would become my favorite, cozy little French café.

If I said it's an understatement to say this place is amazing, then that in itself would be...an understatement. Yes, you read that right. Let's dig into why this may be.

First, the owners are a young French couple; friendly, modest and they speak with a delightful French accent. Some places have one amazing dish, so the choice is easy. Not the case with Bree'osh-each dish is on equal par with every other. If they can't make it perfect, you won't know because it won't be on the menu. The only solution I've found to this delicious dilemma is to try as many things as I can.

Their ""croque monsieur"" was my first experience. The balance of flavors, texture, temperature, and overall aesthetics make me feel like I'm eating a dish prepared by Thomas Keller at his home. Their coffee is fantastic (my girlfriend is a former barista, and wholeheartedly agrees). Their croissant taste like France itself, and the flavors have the power to paralyze me for a brief moment as I completely loose my train of thought.

So yes, I like this place...I really, really do. :-)",2017-02-19 21:09:44

I remember trying their crushcake & that was a good, kind of red velvet! This time around I went for the flavor of the day which was the French toast crunch & the black & white. 

Verdict: I'm a fan! The French toast crunch tastes exactly like the cereal, but I wasn't too pleased with it. Definitely sweeter than the cereal. I liked the black & white cupcake though! As simple of a marble cupcake, not too moist, & a good mix of both vanilla & chocolate all in one. Next time, I would like to try their cafe options. Looks like a well crushed themed cafe to sit & enjoy a dessert, coffee, breakfast (served all day), or any of their baked goods!

Service: It got a little busy before I ordered. While I was looking at the menu & checking out the place, I turned around & the line was almost out the door. The wait wasn't long though. The lady at the register was multi tasking with both paying & grabbing food from the back & front. As soon as she got my cupcakes & made me sign my receipt she left to grab someone else's order without saying a word to me. I didn't know whether I should've waited for her to come back & make sure she got my signed receipt, but I left a bit clueless cause I didn't receive a ""thank you"" or ""enjoy your cupcake"" type of bye. Silly, but when she returned to the front, she handed a customer's order then acknowledged the next person after me. I understand.. they got busy.

*Crushcakes daily specials: call them in advance if you'd like to know their crushcake flavor of the day! I was hoping to try the orange mimosa cupcake, but those bad boys do not come out until Sunday. Next time!",2016-07-15 10:12:19

The place is really charming. You walk in and immediately you are greeted by a bakery case full of sweet treats. For dessert aficionados this is definitely a place you want to stop and stare.  The walls are pink with white siding and there is a small balcony on the 2nd floor. The first floor is set up like a European cafe with many sidewalk tables outside as well as little tables inside.

For about $20 a person, you get to choose from about 6 standard teas. Their afternoon tea is a little different in the sense that everything is full sized, not the bite sized treats you normally get.  The afternoon tea came with open faced ham sandwiches, crab/lobster/seafood sandwiches, fresh raisin scones with raspberry preserve and devonshire cream. The desserts are full sized! Ginormous (i know it's not a word but how else can I describe it )sized napoleans, their famously delicious apple strudel and absolutely melt in your mouth petit fours with almond fmarzipan...mmm...We definitely had enough food to have leftover desserts the next day!

Excellent customer service - everyone was really nice.  I felt kind of bad for the front counter woman as she was having to take orders and make all the coffee drinks (they looked really good but didn't have one).

I got the quiche Lorraine, fresh squeezed OJ and one of each of the five flavors of macarons for a later snack.  The quiche was light as a cloud and while being rich, not too thick or filling.  The ham was perfect and the cheese was perfectly melted and incorporated into the filling.  The crust was perfectly crispy and complemented the smooth, fluffy egg very well.  Probably the best quiche I've ever had - honest.  OJ was great and perfectly naturally sweet.

The best part were the macarons, fluffy with sweet (but not too sweet) filling.  There was chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, raspberry, and coconut.  I think the raspberry and coconut were my favorite.  Not a huge fan of coconut but I could eat these all the time.

Highly recommend.  A customer told me to call them to see if Renaud was cooking and if so, get the omelet!  I think I'll do that tomorrow.

All of the cakes were perfectly moist and flavorful and the icing was just the way I like it - light and sugary, not heavy and buttery.

ALSO - I had breakfast in their cafe and really loved it. Probably had the best chai latte I've ever had (so sad to have to go back to Peet's now, since I was just visiting Santa Barbara for a few days). I loved the house-made granola w/ fruit and granola - simple and nourishing.

Next time I visit Santa Barbara, I will not leave w/out a visit to Crushcakes! :)",2012-03-04 02:51:33

I had an apricot croissant (bought at Renaud's counter in Gelson's) and an almond croissant bought at the Patisserie.  They were flaky,  delicious and the fillings were not too sweet.  The almond was not that cloying stuff often served up, but was more subtle.


I also had the Raclette Cheese Tartine (melted raclette cheese with roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, and bacon on multigrain toast)  which came with a small salad tossed with a tasty vinaigrette.   This dish was disappointing because the ingredients didn't meld together well and the whole thing was rather dry.   The bacon was too subtle under the strong raclette.  The roasted potatoes and caramelized onions tasted fine on their own.   I think it would have been better covered with a raclette sauce, rather than pieces of cheese melted on top.   (Or maybe there was just too much potato.)  I wouldn't order this again.",2013-10-25 18:15:39

Andersen's is the epitome of the quaint and classic cafe. I've been to a lot of brunch places in my time, and I have to say that this is THE complete brunch experience. There are omelets, french toast, waffles, breakfast sandwich, breakfast burritos, I'm pretty sure EVERY breakfast category is covered here, and done WELL. 

Before receiving your order, Andersen's also offers a complimentary danish platter with an assortment of baked goods. Even though these were free, I'd have to say these were some of the best danishes I've ever had, with the custard danish being my favorite. 

Some recommendations/highlights of my breakfast included:

-ARTICHOKE AND BRIE OMLETE: I think this was a special or seasonal option so this may or not be here during your visit, but I think all of the omelets are comparable in quality and taste it just depends on your personal taste/preferences, but I would definitely recommend the omelets. They use really fresh and high quality ingredients, especially good quality cheese and you can really taste the amazing cheeses used in the omelets. Also, the omelets come with a side of roasted potatoes, which for me is a MUST. I do not deem it a good breakfast place unless there are roasted potatoes with your omelets. It's just blasphemy if they don't come together. 

-FRENCH TOAST: We got both the croissant french toast and the french vanilla bean french toast (also seasonal). Both were AMAZING. Hands down one of the BEST french toast I've ever had. The croissant french toast was really interesting as I've never seen ""french toast"" made of croissant. IF the danishes were amazing, trust me the croissants would be amazing as well as they are both specialities to the restaurant.

-BLOOD ORANGE MIMOSAS: 2 for $10. FRESH juice, and good amount of champagne. They are not cheeping out on you for this. 

Overall I had an amazing experience here. The service was good, the ambiance was super cute, and the food was delicious. I am definitely coming back here on my next trip up to SB.",2012-05-30 03:29:33

We used him for our wedding in Montecito this past August of 2013.  Our cake budget was very limited, but Wayne and his staff worked with us to find creative ways to save money.  And even though they knew our budget was small, they NEVER once treated us like 2nd class customers and always gave us above and beyond service through two cake tastings and up to my wedding day.  

First, their pricing with or without discount is the best you will find most anywhere in and around Santa Barbara.  Second, they offer GLUTEN FREE cakes at no extra charge, which was very important to me as we had some Celiacs in our wedding party.  Third, they don't charge a delivery fee in the SB area, which most other places charged $50-75 for.  And 4th, my cake was still a nice big size compared to the dimension other bakers were going to give me for a greater cost.  And 5th, there were so many great cake and filling flavors to choose from...and you can get as many as you want!

Finally, on the weekend of my wedding when I had a million things going on and forgot to bring the decorations for my cake to give them and didn't have time to call Wayne, so just said ""'Eff it', I'll have a plain white cake!  I don't have time to care about that!"" They calmly and discreetly contacted my wedding coordinator who was able to put them in touch with my florist.  Wayne Kjar's staff picked up some matching flowers themselves without me even knowing and when my cake came out, it was the most beautiful cake ever!!!  That is what I call ABOVE AND BEYOND service.  

Everyone loved the lemon cake, the carrot cake, and the gluten free chocolate cake (they couldn't even tell!)  Instead of just simply eating the top layer of our cake next year, my husband and I are going to celebrate in SB every year and get a whole cake from Wayne Kjar!

The marzipan kringles were absolutely delicious. Heaven. I highly suggest getting tons of it because I got a small piece, destroyed it instantly and regretted not getting more.

We also dined at the restaurant, and found it lackluster, like a lot of other Danish restaurants. The food was just average-- I had their homemade pork sausage, and yuck, the pork smelled. It could be because it is really hard to find good pork butchers in the USA -- I've been told they don't slaughter the pigs the right way like we do in Asia, where pork is a more prominent meat source. That said, I couldn't tolerate the smell really, and the whole dish was pretty ruined.

The mister, as usual, had eggs benedict, and thought it was just average.

The Gouda cheese was perfectly melted, the roll was soft and perfect for dipping in the Au jus and there was a tomato on the sandwich as well. Tomato on a french dip sandwich?

When the server asked how everything was, I told him that, honestly, this was not a $30 plate. The sauce tasted like it came off the shelf at Ralph's, and the shrimp was overcooked and dry. There were bits of soggy and wet (but somehow not cooked?) tomato floating around the dish. He was extremely gracious, agreed that it looked a bit off, and offered to ask the kitchen to make something else. I declined (figured I'd just grab something quick later), and he came back out to tell me that it had been taken off our check. A little while later, the owner came out, apologized, thanked us for our input (she said one of the chefs was currently in training), and offered us desserts on the house.

My French toast was exactly how I like it...kinda crispy on the outside but still doughy without being soggy in the middle.

The Classic Breakfast came with everything you'd want for breakfast: pancakes, bacon, potatoes, eggs.  This was definitely filling, but not in an overwhelming way.

The gal at the register was super sweet, just to make things better.

Yes, you read that right!

What an amazingly, well-put, and delicious dish this was!!!

They give you a spoonful of frosting and fresh strawberries and bananas. They also added little chocolate cut-outs that were shaped as hearts. 

I also had the mixed berry Arnold Palmer which was okay. I thought it was going to be something spectacular but it was just mixed berry juice and lemonade.

I've had eggs benedicts before, but this was a twist. The crab cakes were fantastic! It was full of crab meat chunks. The hollandaise sauce was the perfect compliment. My husband and I decided to share the plate, which was just perfect because I think I would have been in a little food coma with all that richness if I ate the whole dish myself. 

We decided to order also the banana and vanilla bean filled crepes topped with fresh berries sauce. That was a great finisher for us...our dessert to our breakfast.

Good job!! The size is right...not super huge American size. The sweetness of the vanilla bean flavor was not overpowering and perfect with a cup of tea. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5, is the shell is a tad on the chewy side for my taste; and the pistacio while texture was perfect, the flavor was very mild. 
Now...the rasberry and salted caramel would get 5stars! Rasberry shell was lightly crumbly and melt in your mouth, and they pair it with a perfect rasberry jam which packs a punch of flavor without super sugar. And the salted caramel...the way I imagine every salted caramel should taste, the shell was delicate but held up the caramel filling...and it was REAL caramel, not a mixed filling, plus no gobs of salt on the top like some other places.  The flavors were all delicate and mixed well.
Overall I wish I could give 4.5 stars, this is my second overall favorite macarons yet!
The flavors were real tasting, did not leave any aftertaste, again...perfect with a cup of tea. Also, at $6.93 for 4 the price is pretty average.",2011-02-21 04:00:13

When staying in DT Santa Barbara this past weekend I took a stroll all the way to the other end of State St to the parallel street just to taste what this place had to offer.  My friend and I got an assortment of 1 dozen cupcakes so we could try everything our hearts desired.  We were not disappointed.  My daughter loved the Red Velvet the best.  I really enjoyed the Bananas Foster and the Vanilla Bean.  But all were great that we tried.  We also enjoyed the fun names for the flavors and some unique flavors as well - Strawberry lemon-aid, lemon drop, coconut, and many more.  They had some other great looking cupcakes that we didn't try - Cookies N Crème, black & white, etc.  I'm not a chocolate fan but there were several chocolate options for the chocolate lover.  I have to say that prior to this experience, I didn't think anything could top the moist cake offered at Sprinkles and the yummy frosting at Teacake Bake Shop - I have often wanted to morph the 2 together for the ""perfect cupcake"" even those both are amazing on their own.  Crushcakes had the perfect match of the moist cake and the yummy frosting - the cupcakes tasted VERY homemade; fresh out of your mother's kitchen type good.

For $28 my wife, daughter and I ate lunch here with a cupcake for my daughter. (No drinks). All in all I was happy with the meal because it was clear the produce and all the ingredients were very fresh, something I'm looking for more and more these days. However something does need to be said about the recipes. My SB Cheesesteak, while it tasted ok, I really felt like it lacked any indulgence whatsoever, hence an 'SB' cheesesteak. It was really just a downsized, de-greaseified, pseudo cheesesteak as is typical in California. While nothing is inherently wrong with that, I wish it was a bit bigger and just a bit more flavorful. Secondly, my wife's 'local produce salad' was very fresh but in some ways just seemed like a mishmash of various local produce, but even with that, the disappointment came with dessert. A single soy-free, gluten-free, vegan cupcake. My daughter and I are lactose intolerant and I've tried all the 'vegan' dessert tricks having been a vegetarian for many years, so I was curious on top of wanting to give my daughter a great cupcake. What we got was a vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting who's cake was granular and a bit bland, with some decent frosting. The same vegan cupcake I've seen around for years. A mediocre one. A bland one. Perhaps they are more well known for other cupcakes, but this one was not worth $3.00 and it was not worth my daughters excitement.

One additional note is more about the clientele and about one of the things I hate most about SB. A complete and total lack of down-to-earth people. Sitting around trying to eat while listening to some of the people here, you can hear the pretentiousness in their voice. It can vary from laughable to unbearable at times and it seems this crowd really loves to eat at this place.",2014-05-28 22:58:34

The egg sandwiches here cannot be missed. The chive butter really gives the sandwiches a nice flavor. They use all organic ingredients which is a huge plus. For pastries, we loved the chocolate croissant and the Almond cream Brioche was to die for. Super yummy and buttery. Note that their pastries have the perfect balance of sweetness.

The Mocha was perfect, the foam was so smooth it tasted like whipped cream. They make their own mocha sauce and you can really taste the difference. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, you can still taste the espresso and that's exactly how all Mochas should taste like! My husband really enjoyed his Cappuccino as well.

We got a table outside with our pup and immediatly felt relaxed. Endless coffee and a few baguette slices and a half strudel were placed in front of us. The coffee had a peculiar spice in it but tasted great and the servers always kept the cup filled. The baguette was to accompany the home made orange marmalade.

The bright, sweet citrus without any pith made plus the fact that it was homemade made this the best marmalade I've ever had. It could be the fact that it's homemade in general. Homemade jams made with ripe fruit deliver the flavor of the fruit as if you were eating it fresh off the tree. Amazing in any case. 

Strudel was delicious. Had a custard one as well. They really know how to make flaky pastries here! 

We ordered the eggs benedict which sits atop a flaky pastry instead of an english muffin. I love it. Husband still preferred muffin. I ordered the sirloin breakfast bc they were out of pork hash. Sad, I love a hash for brunch. Anyhow, I was so full at this poitn that I couldn't eat much of it. It was good though.

It was so good! We even got some seconds of the pastries. All of the pastries were will hot when they got to our table which signifies that they were made fresh. All of our orders were delicious but I would highly recommend three dishes. The crab cake eggs Benedict was a bit new and different than anything I tried before. They were crunchy and complimented the eggs Benedict very well. I LOVED the smoke salmon eggs Benedict. The sauce and everything combined so well and it was scrumptious. My sister ordered the chorizo breakfast plate which was made with eggs and had a side of potatoes which was also delicious and very filling.

Celebrities or, more often, retired character actors, are devoted customers and its proximity to Harry's Bar (very old) makes it a convenient stop after lunch. 

I used to go here a lot when I picked my boyfriend's son up at the nearby school and he loved the eclairs. I have an album on Facebook somewhere of the exquisite bakery cases with little meringue cookies in flavors like pistachio and almond. 

The grilled cheese (gruyere) with onion and tomatoes and a side salad is the only non-baked item I've eaten here; usually I have a glass of 6 dollar wine or a cup of Peerless Coffee (by far my favorite coffee and I only see it here and at Tre Lune, the Montecito fine dining Italian owned by the Bucatini people though I'm not sure which was first). 

They do serve breakfast and prices are about 15% under Jeannine's, its competitor just up the street on State and Ontare. I haven't been in this part of town much the time I am in SB and I kind of forgot all about it as I haven't been doing carpool duty much of late. 

The service is excellent, with young women who really seem to know about the elaborate baked goods they sell. 

I wrote a Yelp review of Xanadu in Montecito and the surprisingly great chicken noodle soup (soup du jour, not on the daily menu). That is a far more basic bakery and some of the cakes are quite heavy on frosting and slightly tacky visually. I'm sure their birthday cakes are perfect for kids' parties or for people who like that old-fashioned confectionary sort of dessert. 

This is, however, the highest-end, non-wedding cake bakery in SB. Jeannine's is as much cafe as bakery though if you're big on scones, that's a better choice. 

Renaud's offers truly beautiful and intricate desserts. It's the foreign or art house of desserts, whereas Xanadu (other than the suburb assortment of cookies) is more the blockbuster of sweets. 

The average kid's eyes will pop out at the more garish, frosting-heavy Xanadu cakes. Only a very refined child will think the offerings at Renaud's, other than basics like croissants and eclairs, drool-worthy. 

This is, in short, where grownups, bakers, and true foodies look for desserts.",2012-09-12 07:40:32

Oh why, oh why are my favorite places so far away?  Why is my sin of choice via shameless gluttony always foiled by the cruel mistress of distance (and finances- note to self:  play the lottery)?

*dabs tears with hankie*

The Canelés seduced my eyes, laying languidly behind the glass pastry case.  The dark, fluted curves beckoned for me to touch.  One bite, and my tongue was enslaved in a loving embrace.  My mouth in an instant was serenading and vowing eternal love, ready to produce roses and a diamond ring  (this is the first time I have seen a Canelé available at a pastry shoppe stateside).

The mouthfeel of the carmelized exterior combined with the custardy bliss was nothing but heaven on Earth.  The glorious flavor or purity, subtlety and simplicity exploded in sublime joy, with symphonies and sonnets drifting in my brain.   My life was not complete before, my sweet Canelé.

So many good reviews, so many hangovers, and so little time to be bold go beyond Isla Vista and Goleta.  I finally made it in the summer after graduation.  My friends and I wanted a nice lunch so why not try Renauds! Normally, I'm not a big fan of sandwiches since I work in a cafe also.  But after trying a croque madame, that was a quick slap to my face! LOL! I ordered the croque madame and my friends had the croque monsieur.  I wanted the madame mainly because of the sunny side up egg.  Ok another point, I'm not a big fan of ham either.  LOL! Once again, blew my mind.  Digging into my sandwich, the taste was so fresh and simple.  I could tasted how the ham, cheese, and the egg combined so well together.  The moment I reached the yolk, the yolk just spread its rich protein towards the sandwich.  I didn't mind it.  Gave a boost more flavor and I added some black peppers to it.  The salad was extremely fresh.  I tasted a bit of vinegar.  The vibe of the restaurant was extremely calm.  By the time I finished my sandwich, I was perfectly content.  The tea I had with it was perfect.  My friend ordered a cake for his own bday.  It was extremely chocolate.  This was all in the same weekend.  We went back the next day to pick it up.  Later that night, the cake was just AMAZING.  Perfect chocolate macaroons and the perfect amount of chocolate inside the cake.  I wasn't overpowered at all by the cake! It was so good that I want to order a cake for myself! Dang, give me that Hello Kitty cake I see on the website.  :)  I sometimes crave the sandwiches here at this restaurant still....thats how much of a lasting impression this place gave on me.

It was early in the day and while I have no rules for appropriate times to consume dessert or alchohol we didn't over do it.

cream frosting)

Verdict! TASTY, cake was moist, frosting was yummy and the cake to frosting ratio was nicely done. 

No issues with the service, the girl at the counter was friendly and welcoming and even when I ordered saying ""we'll try a crushcake"" she was willing to let us try as in sample not try as in I'm ordering this to pay for then try.

We couldn't have been happier with our selection of a brunch spot! When we entered, we were immediately greeted by a delicious display of marzipan pastries. They all looked incredible! The place also had adorable decorations. I was being indecisive when choosing my meal, so our waitress recommended the Charlotte omelette. It had cheese, lots of tomatoes, garlic....all ingredients that sound like they'd be good together, but somehow Andersens managed to make the Charlotte disgusting. I'm not going to let my horrible dish taint my impression of the restaurant as a whole because everything else about the place was great. One of my friends ordered the vegetable and cheese omelette, which she really enjoyed.  It came with a ""surprise"" and we all went crazy anticipating what that surprise would be. Before our dishes came, we thoroughly enjoyed fresh bread and delicious danishes. These danishes were insane! There was an almond and strawberry Danish and another apricot one with chocolate. We later realized that those danishes were in fact my friend's ""surprise""!!  best surprise EVER! It was a kind of a double surprise because we didn't know it was a surprise when we were eating it. Either way, they made us happy. I had some of my other friend's breakfast burrito, which was fantastic! I would definitely order that if I ever go back.

This is the best peanut butter frosting I've ever had, including homemade versions attempting to recreate the magic. I know frosting doesn't equal cupcake, but for this cupcake, it's really the star. 

The cake itself is okay, but I've noticed it's usually too dry for my taste. Sometimes they're moist though and that is truly a delicious cupcake. It just happens too rarely to justify another star. 

I've tried bits of a few other flavors like the red velvet, but none compare to the peanut butter to me. 

At $3 a pop, they are definitely overpriced, but I like to get them as an occasional splurge. The mini versions are about half price, but they don't seem like half a serving, so I still feel ripped off and end up getting the regular sized cupcake. 

Cute little store with cute little cafe attached. If only they stayed open later!",2011-04-30 21:16:40

Personally I am a fan of the eggs benedict, but i feel like they have something for everyone plus they always have great specials.  Not to mention the fact that everyone who orders breakfast gets a starter plate with homemade pastries and baguette. I normally don't have a sweet tooth, but I can't resist the best pastries i've ever tried.  

I could go on and on about breakfast, but one thing I've discovered during my time in Santa Barbara is that most people are unaware that Andersens serves lunch and dinner as well as breakfast and the food is just as good.  The club sandwich might be the best i've ever tried (i know we're talking about a club sandwich, but it really is that good) and the smoked scottish salmon is a refreshing afternoon snack.  If you're in the mood for an full meal, I would recommend taking a look at the specials.  They are different almost every time I come in, and at least one of them is always in the running to be my order.

Like I said before, the pastries are insanely good, but they also have a bunch of desserts.  If you are there for lunch or dinner, your server will bring their dessert tray around and show you a choice selection of the many desserts they have avaliable. Due to my lack of a sweet tooth I rarely order any for myself, but I usually have a bite of whatever my girlfriend orders and its always been great.  The lemon mousse is probably my favorite as it is not as sweet as some of the others, and can be quite refreshing on a hot day.

Lastly, the prices are very reasonable (one of the reasons my girlfriend and I are able to enjoy it so often), especially considering the quality of food and service, and the outrageous prices of other restaurants in Santa Barbara.  I will be moving out of santa barbara soon, but whenever I come back you better believe that the andersens will be my first stop.

Oh and the person who said there is no difference between Andersens and iHop must be smoking crack!!!!",2011-03-23 00:42:01

And we liked D'Angelo's so much that we came back twice during our Santa Barbara vacation. After reading the Yelp reviews, we knew it's self-seating, small and gets busy, so we arrived at 8:30 on both (Sunday and Monday) mornings to grab a table outside. Luckily, we were still on Eastern time, so it didn't seem too early to us. :) On both days, we noticed it was pretty packed by 9. 

I got the fried egg sandwich (I added bacon) on the big, tasty poppyseed roll. The bread was fresh and fantastic. My husband tried the Eggs Rose, which he thought was delicious. D'Angelo's offers to cook the eggs soft, medium or hard.

Service was friendly and prompt. Coffee refills came at a nice pace. The pastries (we tried a blueberry danish and a chocolate croissant) were HUGE and very tasty, but pricey at $5.50 each.

In the morning it smells of a busy warm oven. I got an almond croissant straight off the baking sheet that was sweet, crisp and flaky. The plain croissant was also crisp and flaky, not at all like the large fluffy things we are starting to grow accustomed to at the chain and warehouse shops. 
The chocolate macaroon was to die for. French macaroons are not the coconut haystacky things (although I like those too), think of them more like a light meringue shell encasing a dense creamy filling. The inside of the chocolate macaroon was like a flourless chocolate torte. Delicious.
I bought an assortment of pastries to take home and the counter woman wrapped them up in a pretty brown box and tied it with raffia. 

There is bistro food served here, too. Baguette with jam or cut meats, some simple sandwiches, egg dishes and salads.  One of these sit-down meals will cost around $8-$11 for the dish.  The menu's on the website.

For lunch I ordered the tuna salad sandwich and my hubby got the French Dip au jus.  I don't know if it's because I was hungry and also nearly 9 months pregnant - but I believe that this was the best tuna sandwich I've ever had.  It was the perfect ratio of tuna to bread and was made even more delicious by the fresh dill sauce that they put on it.  It also wasn't soggy like some tuna salad sandwiches get.  My husband was kind of jealous after having quite a few bites of my sandwich.  He said his French Dip au jus was good - but not as good as my tuna salad sandwich. We did skip the dessert because we were full but our server brought out a large platter with all of the options that looked divine.

I have yet to go to the cafe but I am sure that it as yummy as their cupcakes.  You have to get there early because I have yet to see them not sell out.  I love love love their red velvet and strawberry cupcakes.  Cake is always moist and the flavors are always fantastic.  I think I have had every flavor but the red velvet is always my favorite.  The mini cupcakes are also a great buy... I only wish they still had the larger cupcake with chocolate frosting and vanilla cake... they have them as a mini which is good but would love to have them back as the larger size.  Yummy!,2014-03-05 05:41:05

The tables are very small (I felt like I was in Japan) and the tables are very close together but it's just the character of being ""cozy"".  Like many Yelpers noted, the service isn't really there but the food more than compensated for the lacking part of the visit.  We ordered a quiche and breakfast sandwich plates and they give you a plate of ""surprise"" which is a variety of pastries.  The brownies were awesome, just a little sweet and more on a bitter side, the French bread slices, and spiced bread (I think it was pumpkin...not sure but it was good anyway).  Both of our plates were so good we were very happy we stumbled upon this place today.  Orange juice was fresh squeezed and coffee was very fresh and good.  We had to ask for coffee a couple of times when we got there and they never brought us the creamer so we actually turned around and took it from another table that's just been vacated. (I know, I know, but we just needed a little cream!!)  We had to do the same with ketchup and hot sauce when the food came and yup, you guessed it, with the check too.  When we asked to check on our tab after we gave our credit card and waited about 10 minutes, the waitress got a little attitude with a very sweet tone and said, ""he'll bring it to you just as soon as he's ready"" but she came back 10 seconds later wit it because it has been sitting on a counter for about 10 minutes...

It is on the sweet side, but this is what an almond croissant should be like. Actually soft and tasting like a croissant with almond pieces on it. We also got a dozen macarons at the end and they were pretty good for macarons. The lady was nice in explaining the flavors, but they should label them to be more clear. 

The bad:
We had breakfast here, and the breakfast was alright. Came relatively late, but they ran out of orange juice which was a disappointment.

He said if I had been just a bit earlier he had a few left. I told him thank you and I understood because it was 5 minutes to close. He told me to just call next time and they would hold one for me. I explained I was just visiting from out of town. He then gave me two free cupcakes for me and my 3 year old daughter. I told him he didn't have to do that.

We've been to Andersen's before under similar circumstances - heading for one place, but looking for another option when Plan A fell through.  Andersen's is much more than Plan B.  I figured they'd be jammed, and they were busy.  They still had room inside for dessert lovers, and took us to a table quickly.

From host to server to runner to bakery clerk, everyone was friendly and helpful.  We checked out the display cases ahead of time, then enjoyed the presentation of the whole dessert tray by our server.

The adults were happy campers with our selections.  The boys chose to share a mocha-meringue convection that overwhelmed even those two sugar lovers.  They said the mocha was giving them a headache.  Gee, could it have been the hot chocolates they were also sucking down simultaneously?  

Hey, it was Valentine's.  A night for sweet treats.  They slept all the way home in the car.  ;-)

Two extremely friendly cashiers greeted me. I asked what type of buttercream they used on their cupcakes...""American style"" or if they offered a ""Swiss meringue type buttercream"". One of the girl's reply was ""We don't use buttercream in our frostings, just really simple ingredients..."". Umm, WHAT lol??? Okaaaay...not the response I was expecting. She started listing what WAS used for their frosting (sugar, lemon juice, vanilla but NOT butter or butterCREAM). I don't know if she didn't/doesn't understand typical bakery terms OR if she just misunderstood my question? I think she only knew the generic term of ""frosting"" and not the proper term...either way, while she was VERY NICE, I think the staff should have at least a tiny bit of knowledge of what their bakery offers, just my opinion. She then pulled out an official list of ingredients & was totally surprised that BUTTER was in their ""frosting"". Hmm, go figure.

The owner was very kind and helpful along with Leah and the rest of the team who explained our options and gave us the details. The tasting was free accommodating up to 4 individuals which was nice. Their rasberry bouvarian cream and chocolate bouvarian cream were our favorites! Leah was prompt on sending me our receipts and any other information we needed. They delivered our cake to our reception sight at a perfect time and i didn't have to worry about anything. You do have to drop off the flowers if you want to add real flowers to put on your cake, which is understandable and they keep them in a vase to put on the day of. I was so happy when i saw how beautiful our cake was and how perfectly placed the flowers were especially because we had traveled to SB with our flowers and they were slowly dying one by one. I had about 5 or 6 flowers left that survived but i felt they wouldnt go as well so i was a little upset, but to my surprise when i saw the cake i was ecstatic and pleased! They did such a great job with the flowers and the spiral design we wanted. Something i really appreciated so much was that i contacted Leah asking if they could store a homemade pie i baked for my husband because he absolutely loves pie so i wanted to add something and do that nice thing for him. Leah said yes with no hesitation! I dropped it off along with the flowers the day before our wedding. They stored and delivered the pie. I am so grateful for that. It really meant a lot to me. I highly recommend this bakery! We could not have asked for a more perfect wedding cake to add to our beautiful day! Thank you ladies for your service and kindness!

Picture a beautiful staff whose average hipster rating must be 11.  Portion sizes are health conscious without being skimpy.  The cook puts a premium on quality ingredients.  The atmosphere will remind you of every thing you love about the City that makes certain conservatives so very angry.  (The building is a craftsman conversion with hard wood floors.)

The food is healthy without being preachy.  I always get the Tree Hugger (veggies with goat cheese), a demitasse of homemade tomato basil soup and a glass of mint ice tea.  I always leave happy.  It is only my inner curmudgeon that keeps me from giving them that fifth star.",2009-08-15 21:31:42

I went with my family on a Sunday afternoon - we had made a reservation for high tea for the 4 of us.  It didn't end up being a problem that two of us wanted to order the high tea and two of us ordered regular lunch.

When we first arrived, we were standing by the bakery counter and one of the bakers offered us *generous* samples of straight-out-of-the-oven cinnamon walnut bread and it was AMAZING.  Just perfection.  Then, after we'd sat down our waiter brought us some more of the scrumptious bread!!

Our waiter Mitch was very friendly and attentive and even took the time to take a picture of our group with my camera.

The tea was quite good, and the high tea lot - a scone (with jam and cream - not quite traditional clotted cream, but still delicious), two small sandwiches (we had one crab and one ham each), an apple strudel, strawberries, and a petit four - was fantastic.  It was way more than enough food for one meal - we each took home our apple strudels and half of our scones.

The decor is so nice, too!  I think another yelper used the word ""dainty,"" which is a pretty good description.  But it's not so fancy that you are afraid to break something.  It's dainty and cozy at the same time.

Something to note - the upstairs is a bit quieter if you're looking for a more intimate setting.

The small menu and control they exert over it means that their food is not only executed well but they aren't getting tied up with changes/too many things. 

I went with the Croque Madame. The highlight here was the bread. The French know their pastries and it really showed here. Buttery and fluffy it was perfect after a night of wedding partying. 

The service was quick and did their best to turn over tables quickly. On that note, if you are done with your meal at a place like this, here is a hint: LEAVE! There aren't many tables so people are circling looking for that legendary spot. Don't be a table hog. 

That is also my one complaint about this place. I hate places that have limited seating but allow you to still order food even though you don't have a spot. It creates this tension in waiting. You either have to have a friend scoping out a spot to steal or you are worried that a spot will get stolen while you order. It is small issue, but still just adds a layer of stress to breakfast you don't need. 

Good spot for a small group or a couple, but if you are bringing your whole crew maybe pass. Great food though!

Wayne himself was behind the counter that day, and he couldn't have been more pleasant and friendly. I bought two red velvet cupcakes, one with vanilla frosting, one with chocolate, and was delighted that the two of the cost me less than a single cupcake at Crushcakes or Whodelicious. ""I can't justify charging three or four dollars for a little cupcake,"" Wayne said when I remarked on the low price.

The cupcakes didn't come with all the crazy fillings and other embellishments you'll get at other gourmet shops (which in my opinion are often overwhelming anyway), but boy, those cupcakes were delicious enough in their simplicity.

I got the bappled one, which is melted brie with apples and pieces of basil leaves with sourdough bread. A weird, but classic combination that I ended up falling in love with.
Another sandwich I have had from there was the typical caprese panini, with the tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil. Definitely can't go wrong with that.

The only thing is that you can get a side of tortilla chips or salad. Get the salad! No sauce comes with the chips and they're very salty and dry. And that is not a good match with a sandwich. And I have had their salads and they're very refreshing and yummy.

I did try their cupcakes and was not impressed. But don't listen to me about that since I am actually not a cupcake fan :D

I saw you can also dine upstairs.

Came with eggs, bacon, ham, havarti cheese, potatoes and a cup with some apples cooked with bacon. Everything was very simple, eggs were fluffy, the bacon apples were something i could make. But it was all good and filling. My dish for some reason, came with a side of pate, which wasn't on the menu. I passed it off, cuz i'm not a big fan- my friends liked it. The boys both ordered the Sausage breakfasthttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g?select=VoF93_RaAqKwglq5pcfHfw   and my girlfriend ordered the Smoked Salmon breakfast. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g?select=DtEc85hlbgQD-RYqNUKgUg Her dill sauce it came with was nice and sweet, which we also used on the sausages.

The texture was wonderful; crunchy/crusty on the outside, chewy and moist on the inside. It had a delicate almond flavor and I loved the sliced almonds on top. Serious yum. The ""Exotic"" is pistachio sponge cake, mango pineapple passion fruit mouse, then topped with fresh kiwi, raspberry, and papaya. Delicious!! Great flavors that mingled well together and most importantly, it was the perfect amount of sweetness. They make full round cakes of this flavor and I wouldn't hate receiving one on my birthday!

Great spot for breakfast or a snack! Also, there's an in-store bakery at Gelson's Market in the same shopping center that was not nearly as busy as this location and they had all their full cakes on display. Definitely a good alternative if you're in a hurry and still want Renaud's delectable pastries.",2014-07-21 07:49:20

This was delicious. On our last day in Santa barbara we visited here because they are dog friendly, and our delightful white cockapoo came along with us. (They even gave her a bowl for water and a treat, which was a great touch).

I ate something that was almost a chicken pot pie, but not quite. My mom had a great vegetarian sandwich with toasted vegetables and delicious dressing. My dad had a crepe that was perfectly sweet, and my brother ate some sort of beef sandwich that he said was good, but I wouldnt know.

After a year, I couldn't do the 2am thing anymore so I quit.
But, the one thing I always remember being the best thing about baking is the smell of the various aromas that came wafting out of the oven every time I opened the doors.
D'Angelo's Bakery brought me back to those great times.

Up in the SF/Bay Area there a handful of artisan bakeries, whose bread was always used at some of the finest restaurants and cafes. I missed those places very much.
But, D'Angelo's Bakery brought me back to those places.

During my time in Lyon, I stayed with a friend whose apartment was right above a bakery. I always dream of being back there.
And D'Angelo's Bakery brought me back to Lyon.

I had the Black Forest Ham, Eggs, potatoes, and I chose the multi-grained sourdough toast for brunch. I also asked for a side of Hollandaise sauce to dip my potatoes in. (Try it, you'll get addicted...especially if it's as good as D'Angelo's. Ah, but well get into that later.)
The first thing I went for was the toast. The aroma in the air from all the bread product's we driving me crazy and I just had to try the bread first. After spreading some butter over half of the first slice and taking my first bite, I was in bliss.
This is some SERIOUSLY delicious bread.
A second bite and I already know that I was going to 5 stars this Yelp.
I finished of that piece of toast with a piece of over easy egg and yolk and then I went for the potatoes.
Stabbing my fork into a piece of potato, the potato was over cooked they way I like them. They were very soft on the inside and a little bit crispy on the out. Dipped it into the Hollandaise and bang, I was in bliss...again.
This was not your everyday Hollandaise sauce.
Oh no, fellow Yelpers. 
his Hollandaise sauce is the kind of sauce that people who love cooking go out of their way to try and emulate. Or, the kind you hope to find in other restaurants every time you order any kind of Eggs Benedict.
I shit you not.
I tasted oranges, and some other herbs and spices that you don't ordinarily get in other Hollandaise sauces.
There was a point where I nearly forgot about the ham and eggs.
It was all about the multi-grained sourdough toast and the Hollandaise sauce.
These 2 items made the whole meal.
Ah, bliss.

The setting and atmosphere were relaxing and genuine.
The service was really good.
The people who work there at as D'Angelo's are SO very cool.

Oh yeah, I brought 2 lemon tarts with me all the back here to the OC.
I wish I brought back a dozen, because these lemon tarts were kickin'.
That's Bay Area for: Beyond Delicious.

Oh, and yeah. Another reason to visit SB, and soon.",2009-06-16 07:06:29

CrushCafe is both a really homey (like, literally, I think it used to be a home) cafe with tasty breakfast and lunch treats, at a very reasonable price. They serve Intelligentsia coffee. I can comment only on what we had. The hubby had water (lots of water) and the Hangover Cure (which explains the water), and he loved it. Like, couldn't stop raving about it. I had a caramel latte (which was OK, I like my caramel lattes sweet, and it wasn't) and the Peace, Love and Granola. It was super tasty, and I liked their homemade granola. 

Next to the Cafe, they have a Cupcakery. We ordered the Vanilla Bean and the Cookies and Cream for the road. Too bad we didn't try it right there, because we would've easily bought a half dozen. They were both that good.

Kim ordered The Ruben and I sampled the Smoked Scottish Salmon which was the best lox plate I've ever tasted: crispy-sweet chef toast topped with creamy havarti, fresh salmon, tomato slices, capers, a hard-boiled egg and a delicious balsamic dill sauce.  Unfortunately, while we were mid-way through lunch, another waiter (not ours) came up and tried to hustle us out the door commenting, ""Are you going to get dessert or can I just give you your check now so you can pay?""  .... And we replied that we were going to order dessert, after we finished our meal, but would like to look at the bakery items in the case across from us.  The waiter sarcastically responded, ""well that's fine, I guess we'll just have to give you your check later.""  Oddly enough, asides from us and two other couples, the place was empty....why was he trying to hustle us out?

After that, we finished our lunch, took a peek at the bakery items and ordered desserts.  Kim sampled the Pumpkin Strip - a pitifully sad name for an incredible pastry made of flakey dough, marzipan, pumpkin and almonds.  I ordered the Dutch Apple dessert - which was served ice-cold.  When I asked if it could be heated up, I was told that they couldn't do that because it was traditionally served cold and it would pretty much fall apart and make a mess if it were heated.

My only complaints are the relatively meager selection, and that the vast majority of the tarts and pastries are unlabeled. As I said, I don't go out of my way to eat at French patisseries too often, so I barely know how to pronounce many of the offerings, much less know them by sight to ask for them.

I was disappointed that they were out of chocolate croissants, but it made me venture to the almond, so I can't complain. It didn't taste much like a croissant at that point, but was delicious anyway.

We had hot chocolates as well, which were not sweet, thus keeping us from falling into a sugar coma.

They also have mini, bite sized cupcakes which are $1.25/each in about 5 flavors. The regular sized cupcakes are $3/each but for every 11 cupcakes, you get one free. I bought a dozen. I could not resist! But to be fair, half dozen were for friends and I shared the other half dozen with my brother and boyfriend. 

These cupcakes are simply delicious -- perfectly moist cake and light, creamy frosting. I especially loved the red velvet (named the ""crush cake"", which had a sour cream frosting (rather than the typical cream cheese frosting) and a chocolate heart in the frosting! I also tried the strawberry, carrot cake, lemondrop, cookies & creme, and chocolate satin. I thought the strawberry and cookies & creme were both excellent. The other 3 were not bad, either. (My boyfriend loved the lemon drop for its tartness). I liked that the frosting was not overpowering, but the flavors were strong and the perfect amount of sweetness. 

Aside from the taste, I think that Crushcakes has one the best presentations for cupcakes I have yet tried. There is not a uniform look to the cupcakes and each one has a unique presentation (i.e. the half oreo on the cookies & creme, the pink chocolate flakes on the strawberry, the chocolate heart on the crush cake, etc.). They are simply beautiful. 

Crushcakes... you should be on Cupcake Wars. You would win, hands down.",2011-05-09 04:36:05

This is a cute little cafe that offers a wide variety of breakfast/brunch items which all sound amazing and I had the hardest time deciding.

My husband had the ham and brie sandwich and chose the tomato and basil soup to go with it (you get a choice of soup, salad, or chips).  He loved the sandwich and I loved that the soup had a cute sour cream heart on top.  The soup was super tiny, but he was very glad it was because it was super filling, especially after a big sandwich and just before we went out on a boat.

I decided to go with the black and white which consists of two fried eggs served over their house made black beans served with grilled bread.  Everything was great, the eggs were cooked perfectly and were not greasy (as is how i remember fried eggs from when i was a kid) and the toast was superb.  especially appealing and intriguing was the butter that the put on the bread.  I cannot put my finger on it as to what they but in the butter, but it is not normal butter, it almost tastes like candy, and that is a good thing!  But a little does go a long way, I couldn't eat all that they gave me for my toast.

I also had the mexican hot chocolate which is only $2-something and it is a huge glass of super frothy, spicy, chocolatey hot chocolate.  I couldn't finish the entire thing, but not because it didn't taste good, because it very much did.  Perhaps the best Mexican hot chocolate I've ever had.

When a day trip to Solvang changed to a wine-tasting, walking around State Street in S.B. day, I stumbled upon this Danish Restaurant and bakery. Perfect! I got lunch and my marzipan fix in one sitting! 

Conveniently located along state street between Figuerora and E Anapamu Street, this supercute, kinda classy/tea party chic place is picture perfect with lovely outdoor seating, super friendly service, pastries galore, and 2 dining room and an upper level which is either for High Tea or parties. This place is so quaint and cozy me and my friend talked about how this place would be good for a variety of events: high tea, birthday parties, wedding receptions, engagement/anniversary parties, etc. 

Now, the to good stuff: 

When we first sat down, we were greeted several times by our server and other employees that walked by. And instead of the sometimes customary bread and butter basket, we got a slice of Kringle. In case if you do not know what that is, Kringle is a pretzel shaped pastry that is made of almond filled coffee cake. *Gulp* This Kringle seemed to be sent from the Danish Gods! SOOO GOOOD. *Cue 2 drooling girls who had to use every fiber of our being to not to tear apart the entire bakery, eating all the Kringle and any marzipan related product. It was that good. And we wanted more than our complimentary sample. Alas, we decided to eat some lunch. I ordered a veggie sandwich that suspiciously tasted sweet and buttery. I think their baker also handles their cuisine! Even my friend's chicken sandwich seemed to have butter streaming down her hands. Seriously. I'm not a huge butter fan, but it tasted delightful!
 
When we parted Anderson's, we spent some time moseying around State street shopping, wine tasting and hating the trolley, but after a while we decided to come back for more! This time when we sat down, we got bread with some type of jelly. Our waiter assured us that it was tasty. Me and my friend both hesitated since it was a hot day and we had already been wine and olive oil tasting. Yet he was right and it was quite nice! We decided to order an item off of their happy hour menu, some type of crusted Brie with raspberry Merlot sauce. Oh. My. Word. Insane in the Brain Good! After that we shared a slice of the Princess cake, which has an outer layer of marzipan which comes in fun colors and has layers and layers of goodness. 

This bill seemed to be a bit pricier than lunch which was around $11 or $12 a plate, this time around I think the Brie plate was $12 or $13 dollars, the slice of cake $10!

All in all,  I don't think I would go anywhere else when spending a day in Santa Barbara. I'm sold! Andersen's is my favorite restaurant!! (Just make plans to hit the gym for a solid 2 weeks after each visit!) : p",2012-08-31 03:02:07

Crushcakes has a little cafe on one side, and a take-out for cupcakes on the other side.  We tried the carrot cake cupcake (special of the day) and the strawberry cupcake.  To me, all carrot cakes taste alike, so the carrot cake cupcake didn't do anything for me, but my husband said it was good.  The strawberry cupcake was out of this world.  The frosting was magnificent - you can tell they use real strawberries (you can see the tiny little seeds in the frosting) and it's not too sweet.

It was a lovely morning so we were seated outside as soon as we arrived. They were serving a special easter menu that day, which is smaller than their usual menu but still offered plenty of choice.

We started with their mimosas (2 for $10 special) and their complimentary bread and pastries. Their raspberry danish is yum! I ordered their Good Morning Breakfast, and hubby got their Vanilla French Toast. 

Their service is very fast and their staff are very friendly....our waitress in particular was lovely. Hubby really enjoyed his french toast. I tasted it, and it was good....better than the Vanilla French Toast at Tupelo Junction. I also got to eat his blueberries and strawberries since he is anti fruit. Win for me! He also ordered a side of eggs, which also came with a piece of bacon. Like any good man, he loves bacon so this made him very happy.  My Good Morning Breakfast was ok. The scrambled eggs were a bit underdone. The potatoes were delicious, but there weren't many on my plate. The harvati cheese was interesting, and the ham reminded me of the stuff from home (which equals good, btw). The plate also came with Chicken Liver Pate, which I did not eat because I'm not enough of a grown up to eat Pate. The mimosas were great....mostly champagne which is how they should be!

One thing that irritated me was that their outside tables wobble like crazy, we had to get napkins wedged under it so we could eat without spilling everything.

I think we will be back so we can try their usual menu. It looks pretty tasty! And next time I will tell them to hold the Pate and cook my eggs a little longer!

In our initial discussions with Jenna (their catering manager), we decided to also have Crushcakes cater all of the food for our brunch from their fantastic menu.  

Jenna was a tremendous help and assisted in how to best tackle a party of 50 with superb suggestions and guidance about how much food to order to ensure nobody left hungry.  Our large order was not only hand-delivered by a super sweet Crushcakes employee the day of the event, but he was early and very thorough in reviewing the entire delivery to verify that every morsel was included.  

Multiple guests commented on the taste and quality of the food and inquired as to who we'd catered from.  Thanks to CC's excellent combination of sophisticated and kid-friendly choices, we were able to satisfy every palette and ensure every belly was full and happy.

We'll use Crushcakes again and again.  They make hosting extremely easy and convenient.  Extra thanks go to Jenna for her kind and knowledgeable assistance in guaranteeing our event was a great success.  Oh and the cupcakes.......they were equally as amazing.

Okay so they are only open for breakfast/lunch/brunch. Our group didn't ordered when we were supposed to because we were waiting on 2 other people. But we eventually got to order, and we waited, and waited, and waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive! The waitress kept us in the dark, she didn't tell us why our damn food was taking so long, but like 5 minutes before our food finally came out, she ""apologized"" for the delay because they were short staffed. Umm, you couldn't tell us that like 30 minutes ago! That way we know what's going on?! BAADD SERVICE but I guess at least she apologized? I don't know because I went in to get some bread/pastries, I didn't want to order from our table, hell no was she getting more tip then she deserved. The cashier had pretty horrible service too. She was slow, and when I got up to the line, she said ""one second i'll be back"" and briefly left for a minute. I was like ""WTF?!"" Okay, horrible service...I was angry and hungry.

Then our food finally came out, I think they served everyone who sat in the restaurant first, and then the front patio, THEN the back patio (where we sat). I was soo pissed, but I finally got my food, I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict. I was so pissed but then I tasted the food and I swallowed...it was DELICIOUS, my mood was totally changed right after, I wasn't pissed anymore, I was so delighted with the way it tasted, and how great the food was. The salmon was really tender and just right, the eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked, and the bread under was a lightly sweet, buttered bread. it all went well, it was really good and that's the only reason this place got 4 stars, if it weren't for the food, it would gotten a 2 or 3.

It was a yummy vanilla bean cake (with plenty of v. bean specs visible throughout) topped with a sweet white chocolate frosting. Each part was good enough to eat on its own, and, when combined, even more delightful - like Voltron. What I'm about to say is not a complaint, but I want to mention that the frosting was quite sweet (which I like) and, if you're not paying attention, you might think it merely an exquisite vanilla. Take the time to savor the experience, however, and you will realize that this cupcake tastes like a Starbucks white chocolate mocha! (At least *I* think so, and that totally won me over.)

Sister had classic eggs, bacon/sausage and potatoes which also came with some kind of pate' that was nasty (I'm just not a fan of pate') . Daughter had breakfast burrito (odd for Danish place) it was also great, I had it as a leftover later. Son had Belgian waffles, loved them.

If you've read my previous Yelp, you know what the place is like - so I'll only go over our most recent experience.

The wife was hungry, but didn't want anything heavy.  She ordered a Fruit Salad and asked them if they could include some extra of the fruits she enjoyed the most.  A few moments later, a kind older woman came out with a slight European accent to regretfully inform us they were out of those particular fruits - but suggested some others my wife might like.  Wifey agreed and was glad she did.  The size of the salad was impressive!  Certainly meal sized!  And the fruit was fresh and delicious, and wifey was in heaven.

I myself ordered a traditional Sausage plate which was absolutely delicious!  Everything was also presented very well and the service was attentive.

What also stood out about our visit is that Kyle, the waiter from our month-previous visit, stopped and recognized us.  He even remembered my wife's name (since its the same as his mother's).  He took time from his job to chat with us and ask us about our visit to Solvang during Danish Days, gave us some tips on places on State Street to visit - and even gave us a discount card for 15% off our next visit.

That's the kind of service that makes a place like this stand out and earns Andersen's a 5th star.  We'll certainly make a habit of eating here whenever we are in town.  If you can, ask for a waiter names Kyle and tell them Wayne and Diane from Yelp sent you!",2011-11-16 05:23:02

The almond croissant was good but not quite as fresh. And the fried egg sandwich tasted very good. The bacon is nice and smoky, which makes the sandwich delicious.

There's no lot, so you'll just have to find street parking somewhere but it didn't seem that difficut to find parking, even for all three of our cars. The cafe is small with some outdoor seating and a small counter with stools in addition to their normal tables. If it gets busy, I can see that seating would become a problem, especially if you have a large group. Lucky for the 7 of us, a group of 8 had just left, so we swooped in and claimed it before anyone else could :3

So you order/pay at the register and then take the little number placard thing back to your table to wait. The staff here are so friendly and very knowledgable about the menu so don't hesitate to ask them about their food.

I had a taste of everyone's food and I had to say, my favorite was the cafe skillet. In fact, I woke up the next morning craving it. It's cubed roasted potatoes, chilis, bell peppers, cheese, and bacon with two fried eggs on top. I wish it came out on a skillet though, I think that would have helped keep it warm because it got cold after a while. I know all that food can be a bit heavy so instead of coffee, you should wash it all down with their Black Pearl iced tea. Their Black Pearl is iced black tea with coconut agave and almond milk...it was perfect and so refreshing!

It was stuffed evenly so that every bite was amazing, and it was grilled in addition, which was a nice touch.

Our breakfast took a bit longer than the owner (who took our order) wanted (we were completely fine just sipping coffee and reading newspaper, etc), and we were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary strawberry rhubarb muffin for the wait. This gesture was above and beyond and really showed how much pride the owner takes in her business and the degree of attention paid to timing and customer satisfaction.

We walked in just before 9:00 PM and made our way to the pastry counter when we were greeted by a super friendly young man named Darrick (Derrick?) asking what we were interested in trying. I mentioned that I wanted marzipan and he quickly offered up helpful suggestions with a few small samples to try of each. He was engaging, witty and engaged me in some great conversation about LA (I was wearing a bright blue Dodgers hoodie), the Lakers, Kobe Bryant and a fun family story all while putting together our order. He greeted every person who walked in with the same
hospitality and friendly smile. The pastries themselves were *amazing* - we sampled the kringle which was fantastic, but went home with his recommendation: a buttery, marzipan-rich concoction called a ""buttering,"" clearly made by angels & fairies  and that I would never have ordered on my own. It looked like a boring take on a cinnamon roll but I could not have been more wrong- get it, get it now. I also grabbed some marzipan petit fours and got to try the chocolate rum balls- all amazing.

I live 90 minutes north, and I had no business strolling around Montecito until the day my girlfriend got a job there...right next to what would become my favorite, cozy little French café.

If I said it's an understatement to say this place is amazing, then that in itself would be...an understatement. Yes, you read that right. Let's dig into why this may be.

First, the owners are a young French couple; friendly, modest and they speak with a delightful French accent. Some places have one amazing dish, so the choice is easy. Not the case with Bree'osh-each dish is on equal par with every other. If they can't make it perfect, you won't know because it won't be on the menu. The only solution I've found to this delicious dilemma is to try as many things as I can.

Their ""croque madame"" was my first experience. The balance of flavors, texture, temperature, and overall aesthetics make me feel like I'm eating a dish prepared by Thomas Keller at his home. Their coffee is fantastic (my girlfriend is a former barista, and wholeheartedly agrees). Their croissant taste like France itself, and the flavors have the power to paralyze me for a brief moment as I completely loose my train of thought.

We had planned to split something, but I'm glad I got my own, because I finished the rest of my sandwich that night, and savored every bite! The bread itself had an amazing flavor, and the whole thing tasted so FRESH! Bonus-- they have Mexican Cokes in glass bottles (made with real sugar), which is the only kind I'll drink. 

And then there's the coconut cupcake... I absolutely love coconut cake, and this one could NOT have been any tastier! I liked the texture and flavor of it better than the ones I've had at Sprinkles-- absolutely perfect. My only regret is that I didn't get an extra one to go!

It seemed pretty busy on a beautiful sunday morning.  We checked out their menu and a couple other restaurants down the street and came right back to this place.  

We enjoyed our delicious meal outside in the gorgeous weather over the weekend.  Our waitress brought out a plate of bread and apple danish, what a nice surprise.  We had the eggs benedict and it came with the puff pastry instead of your typical english muffin.  It was delicious!!  My girlfriend had the crabcake benedict and it was very tasty and full of crabmeat unlike crabcakes i've had before that were mostly breading.  I had the eggs benedict florentine and it was delicious, however, I think it would've been better with fresh spinach instead of frozen spinach.  Our table shared the Belgian waffles since we all wanted a little of both sweet and salty.

After brunch, we walked inside the restaurant to check out the bakery and everything looked sooo good!  They were giving out samples but I couldn't put another thing in my mouth.  One side of the restaurant was decorated very cute and sweet.  The other side was very elegant.  They had an upstairs dining area but we didn't go up there.  

It was a nice find and glad we decided to dine here.  Great place to people watch.",2011-05-04 00:57:15

Some of my favorites:
-House made hot chocolate: UNREAL, because its the real stuff, no powders. My recommendation is to grab one of these suckers before the epic-ly momentous SB Christmas parade. Ha Ha.
-Haakenbof (spelling?) The gravy is amazing, meat high quality, and their red cabbage might be better than my German father's

-MARZIPAN. Every traditional and non traditional pastry featuring marzipan, they probably have it. Their princess cake is divine

I've been here before but I don't remember having such a solid dining experience.  We rode beach cruisers in non-beach cruiser riding apparel (and shoes) from Montecito Inn to State Street then walked over 6 blocks to enjoy some lunch.  The girls wanted either Arigato Sushi (which didn't open until after 5pm) or Cafe Buenos Aires for their sangria but right when we walked up to Andersen's and saw all the people enjoying their food and basking in the sun all of a sudden we wanted nothing more than to sit and enjoy a meal here.

We sat in the shade since we were burning up from our walk and ride... within 5 minutes we were cold so we moved in after ordering our beverages... normally you see services throw a mini-fit when people do this as usually servers are assigned to a certain area of a restaurant.  Well when it is not too busy this restaurant will share their areas and the responsibility of checking in with their customers (which makes perfect sense and happy customers)... everyone that came by our table was lovely, professional and had a nice smile.

We ordered a Louie Salad w/Grilled Chicken, Smoked Scottish Salmon an opened face sandwich, a French Dip au Jus and I ordered the Club 1000 Sandwich and we all shared.  I got my club on whole wheat although I was tempted to get the French Roll or Croissant and my steak fries were amazing (probably too soft for many but perfect for me) especially dipped in their even killer ranch dressing (I know so ghetto!)... the coleslaw I didn't get since it had mini chunks of pineapple... everything else made sense...

Curry Chicken sounded good as did the Schnitzel and can't forget the 
Euro Iced Coffee (espresso & vanilla ice cream) so hopefully I will have a chance to try them soon.  Great place to pick up a dessert or two for a friend or yourself... and they serve wine and beer.  A cold Stella was perfect after that bike ride.",2011-06-15 14:30:43

There is lunch until 2:30 ( except for 'maintenance days' when they stop serving at 2 pm. No dont ask me about that because I'm not clear about how to know when those days are scheduled.) 

 Please be sure you bring your data device with you because there is NO WAY to know what the offerings are according to the cashier! Per his suggestion, you can look online. Hmm. Okay. Clearly there IS A MENU somewhere, right? You know, the kind you can look at in the restaurant without consulting a computer?  I am obviously a little skeptical that there isn't  a printed menu and was perplexed as to why the cashier appeared to be hoarding information. It gives a whole new meaning to 'secret menu,' right? 

I picked a couple of pastries from the case. Sadly I really wanted a pain aux raisins,  but they were out. Oh well, maybe another time. Then  I ordered a coffee...that was easy because there is a coffee menu above the register. The cashier put the pastries on a plate and gave me a number to take to my table and said they'd bring the coffee when it was ready....and then swung his computer screen our way to sign for the charge and add a tip. Tip? For what? 

So I got past the fact that the counter help wasn't helpful as soon as I tried the pastries. The chef is talented. Really talented. The raspberry tart is amazing...not too sweet, perfect in every way. I also had the apricot tart...the apricots were yummy and were baked on puff pastry. I wasnt a huge fan of the puff pastry, but my sister who is as judgmental as I am about pastry liked it just fine. And now the brioche. It is really good brioche. The Brioche Queen (yeah, you, sis) gave it an A plus. 

So yes, I will be back. And if I lived here I would try to make peace with the doosh because I would need him to provide my fix. But I was just passing through....and will be sure to pass by here again next time I'm in the area.

My wife and I tried out the 3-egg omelet with our choice of filling. Everything from the sides that accompany the dish, to the presentation was great.

I want to go back to eat here again and to kayak. My Americano was delicious and my granddaughter's mocha was awesome. The side of fruit was fresh and delicious. The women working this day were very nice and very helpful even though they thought we were weird for letting an 11 year-old have a (small) mocha :-)

I will be back! Oh, and did I mention that I though their prices were extremely reasonable for the quality of food? And we loved the little outside patio! I'd give this place 10 stars if I could.",2015-04-10 19:57:41

This quaint little bakery had a sense of old world, victorian elegance with chandeliers, white clothed square tables with flowers, bright colored walls, and a patio area right on the sidewalks of State St. 

Being lunch time and also a bakery, a hearty sandwich was in my horizon.

Their crab salad sandwich was everything I dreamed of in a crab salad sandwich. Fresh crab with cilantro, lettuce, tomatoes, and sprouts on a soft croissant. Delish. Served with coleslaw and steak fries, this definitely kept me full for quite a while. The sandwich was big, the croissant was moist, soft, and slightly crunchy on the outside. The crab tasted fresh and flavorful, not rubbery or chewy. I even give them props for the incredibly tasty coleslaw that I usually leave untouched. Not this one. With pieces of pineapple (!) and not overly creamy, it was light and perfectly balanced. 

We ended up coming another day for their pastries. I  mean, how can you visit a Danish bakery and not try their desserts? Plus, my girlfriend is a sugar fiend, so seeing her in a bakery is much like how Gollum treats his ""precious"" in Lord of the Rings. 

I do admit, I am not much of a dessert fan or a sugar lover, so I am incredibly picky and can only handle so much. However... their Almond Marzipan Butter Ring is breathtaking. I mean, it's gotta be illegal somewhere. Rich, creamy, soft, buttery, and a subtle punch of almonds. It's not like a strong almond jab, but more of a cool nod. It's like when you're in a coffeeshop with your mac, and you make eye contact with another mac user. You look at each others macs and then back up and do that slight nod acknowledging the fact that ""yup, that is indeed a mac, and you are okay in my book."" This slice of Marzipan Butter Ring, was alright in my book. And if I could have made eye contact with the baker who baked it, I would have given him the cool nod.",2012-06-13 01:12:58

The frostings are really good too, where they actually put real fruit puree into their frosting so the strawberry or lemon flavor wasn't artificial tasting.  I would have to say that if you go here make sure to buy the fruit based cupcakes because they were awesome.  Even the cake part had real fruit in them, you could see the seeds from the strawberries in the cake and the consistency of the cake reminded me of really moist banana bread or carrot cake.

This place has a hidden gem feeling. It's not off of State St and it's behind a few other surrounding businesses. Walking up to D'Angelo's and it's basically find a seat and take a menu with you. Few minutes a waiter comes up and serves me water for myself and company.

The menu is fairly small but lists some good choices. I'm fairly old fashion and get their Black Forest Ham Steak & Eggs Any Style. Instead of the Ham, I opted for the Bacon and instead of the toast, got the croissant bread. Eggs were scrambled.

The wait wasn't too long and was about average 15-20 minutes.

We ordered coffees and it was quite tasty. Came with a cool little saucer of milk.

When the food came out we were pretty blown away. The eggs were made perfect, and the bacon was a very thick cut that was crispy yet chewy. Just the way I like it. Croissant was buttery and flaky as I expected it to be. It came with some homemade jam as well and some things of butter.

It's chunky, bitter, weird and though, in theory, should be lovely, usually is the opposite.

I have been eating here for years on trips to SB but recently took a fussy old lady relative for lunch and she loved it. LOVED it. She ordered the Hungarian Goulash which was recommended by our fabulously friendly waitress who was from Singapore -- so old lady relative being well-traveled discussed Singapore shopping with her for quite a while. Sorry other tables for your wait. Then relative, after eating the goulash, met the chef who was from someplace in Europe so she and the relative discussed the fabulous goulash and whatever it is her country is famous for (it was not Hungary, I'm not that forgetful).

Their cakes are MOIST and delicious.  They do have a lot of that weird almond stuff though, marzipan is it?  Maybe it's a famous Danish thing, but I don't like it!

The food served for lunch is a 2.  I've eaten here for lunch a couple of times and their sandwiches just don't do it for me.   I mean, they're not horrible but they put lettuce and tomato on their french dip.  That's the equivalent of putting your shoe in your soup.  People just don't go around putting their shoes in soup, so they shouldn't put lettuce and tomato on a french dip, GAHHH!  

The food served for brunch is a good 3 or 4 I'd say.  The omelets are delicious, fluffy, and stuffed thick.  You could get one mimosa for $8.95, or you could get 2 for $12.  I think I just made your decision for you on that one.

We stopped by for breakfast and the food was so great, we decided to stop by AGAIN for breakfast the next day! 

First visit- I had the huevos rancheros which have always been a favorite breakfast staple for me. D'Angelos actually made a little twist to it. instead of just soft tortillas at the bottom- they fried it into a tortilla chip almost and then placed all the toppings on it (eggs and all). It was the perfect combination of crunch and gooey-ness. YUM. The salsa was fantastic and just the right amount of kick. My boyfriend had the Eggs Rose which was two poached eyes over olive bread with artichoke spread. You can get your poached eggs cooked well, soft or hard and they come out like two perfect little mounds. The artichoke spread was great and smooth and the bread had a surprising kick of olive to it like the olive at the end of the martini. :D

Second day, I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and the boyfriend had the BLT. Both were amazing, BUT- the BLT was most impressive. The BACON was THICK AND HUGE!!!! Loved it.

oN0gVFVu3pRGvGV4DSKYQQ,yF5zw2Uqyy9_WqFt2Em-Og,UuRZpgZsHX7PyykHV3wbZg,5,1,1,0,"BEST..... CUPCAKES..... EVER.

I'M SERIOUS.

Ok first off, I have to give a disclaimer that I'm not a HUGE huge fan of cupcakes. Don't get me wrong, I love me a good cupcake here and there, but they're not exactly a staple of my high-protein, high-fiber diet. Also, when I lived in Santa Barbara everyone ate Crushcakes and some people would drive DOWNTOWN in the middle of rush hour to get these babies, and I thought ""... for $3.25 EACH?!?!? ... AS IN, PER CUPCAKE? uhhh... NO!!""

So with that said, I was a skeptic. I've had everything from mediocre home-baked cupcakes (no offense to my sister) to gourmet cupcakes from cupcakeries scattered across California and I never thought specialty cupcakes were all that great, but seriously... I dream about Crushcakes.

SO incredibly soft, and moist, and perfectly sweet. All of the flavors are bomb dot com and even flavors that I normally detest (aka anything lemon-flavored, strawberry-flavored, peanut butter... *shiver*) 
IIII LOOOOOVE AT CRUSHCAKES! They're soft, but not TOO soft. They're moist, but not TOO moist. They're sweet.... but not TOO sweet!

The Cupcakery itself is located in a little section in downtown Santa Barbara and it can be a little hard to find if you don't know what you're doing (navigation is key!). Also you have to find street parking in front of the shop or nearby (no, you cannot park in that lot down the street) which can be a bit of a hassle. But the inside decor is super cute and the girls who work at the front are usually cheerful and very patient while I hover over the cupcake display case with drool dripping down my chin, so the trip is well worth it. ALL of the flavors are delicious... try as many as you can! 

The only thing I would say is that although the cupcakes have a good consistency, they are very soft; so if you're planning to let them sit around for a couple hours they will start to sag and get kinda... smushed by gravity. The prices are average, about $3 a cupcake, but for heaven in your hand... I think that's a damn good deal!",2011-04-10 23:19:06

First of all...they have a 4,000 sft space dedicated almost entirely to their oven and leave very little seating room for their customers, which should tell you something about their priorities. Secondly, the highlight their home-made jams, which indicates they understand the purpose of bread better than every other business I'm about to name. Lastly, I don't recommend their croissant breakfast sandwich for anyone over 50 as it may take your life (what's pleasure without risk?), however it's got to be the best-executed version of that concept I've ever known....namely because the croissant itself is simeltaensouly so light, crispy, and doughy, which provides the perfect contrast to the savory-gooey layers of cholesterol squeezed between those bread handles. What does LA have?  We have the Village Bakery and Cafe in Los Feliz, which is pretty solid as an all-around source of deserts and sandwhiches, but their breads don't blow me away. We have Eagle Rock bakery, which is actually pretty incredible, but, again, draws my attention far more for their wide array of deserts than their breads and croissants. We've got Union in Pasadena, which is the best, lightest, and most uncomplicated (that's a good thing) croissant I've found in the area, making it a top choice. We've got Elsa's in Highland Park which is an insanely good choice for Mexican sweet breads etc, but not your traditional French or American bakery. Patticakes in Altadena is one of my all-time favorites, but again -- for their cakes, caramel apple muffins, and cream cheese chocolate muffins-- not so much their breads and croissants. And then there's Proof in ""Atwater"" (I'm sticking to the quotes until someone can show me LA city ordinance map with the word ""Atwater"" written on it), which has absolutely solid execution, but not a ton of recipes I'm in love with. I've never tried Ruby Bakery (SHOULD II?!?) but Google seems to think it's great. And I just can't bring myself to take Canter's seriously as a bakery, although the real estate they dedicate to glass cases alone should earn them some recognition.

We left with a sourdough boule which we just used to make sandwiches. I've been baking my own bread for over 10 years now and I rarely buy bread.

CrZDWMA4dhXlb61Bg4IpJg,FlTvvkBUh-mdQ35fpz6WzA,VAIOtbsxdNmuhUKkQZFRlA,4,3,1,3,"A friend and I both got the croissant; he got iced tea while I got a hot tea. It's true what everyone says - best croissant I've had in the United States. It's got that pure buttery flavor, rich and moist on the inside, with a flaky brittle crust on the outside. Afterwards, I had no reason to eat anything more because it was made so well, it resulted in my feeling of fullness. 

BUT if I have one weakness, its macarons (also known as ""macaroons""). These pastel colored lovelies are something I'd give my firstborn child away for, as long as it is done right. I have not had a decent macaron since Paris (2 years ago) and have been on a quest to find one that is just as delightful and pleasing to my palate as those sweethearts I left in France. 

I ordered 4 macarons. Of the 4, only 2 I felt were on par with France. The other 2 were ""okay"" but felt somewhat brittle and stale in quality. Like I had the macaron that'd been sitting in the window display for a little too long. Also, I'm not a fan of macarons that have more of a jelly like type filling, sometimes used in fruit flavored macarons. I'm a cream filling gal when it comes to my Parisian pastries. The two exceptional ones, one of which escapes me, but the other - damn. So good. It was coconut. And I HATE coconut. but I LOVED the macaron. It was perfect - the outer cookie was the right degree of soft inside and slightly hard on the outside. The cream was delicious - not overpoweringly sweet, but enough to make you feel tingles along your tongue and down your throat. A good macaron makes you feel like the world has stopped and nothing matters except you and this delicious goodie - and that's what that coconut macaron did. 

Thank you, Renaud. 

With that said, my regrets include: not having tried everything in the bakery cases (because they all glistened and glittered, asking patrons to have a taste), having paid 14 bucks for a breakfast of two croissants, two teas, and a handful of petite macarons, and lastly not having said, ""Sup?"" when Renaud was walking around the patisserie.

My boyfriend brought me back a Strawberry Cupcake and it is uhh-freakin-mazing. Yes it got a bit squished in the bag after 5 hrs, but nonetheless it obviously still tasted great. The first bight was of the icing which is GREAT. The cupcake itself is decent, I probably would like it just a tad more moist (but this could also be due to the fact that it was sitting in a warm car for a while). But anyways, the cake + icing together were fantastic ( think of that scene in Ratatouille when the little mouse describes the bliss of flavors coming together, my moment was something like that).

Not only will you find cupcakes in this area at Crushcakes Cupcakery, you will find GOOD cupcakes at Crushcakes Cupcakery!!

These cupcakes are fantastic!!  So fresh and scrumptious.  The cakes themselves are moist, and the frostings on top are light.  Both the cake and the frosting of each cupcake I tasted had great flavor, and left me satisfied.  My friend and I went around 2:30pm one afternoon, and the kitchen was steadily busy making fresh batches of cupcakes!  The smells coming from the kitchen were heavenly.  These bakers also make a variety of flavors, some unique and some classics--the perfect combination, as you can pick a safe flavor and try something different if you're adventurous.  We chose the chocolate cupcake and black-and-white [essentially a marble] cupcake.  Both were very, very delicious!!  

My friend and I are from the east coast and visited here, first because we wanted cupcakes, and second because the bakers of Crushcakes have been on the Food Network's show ""Cupcake Wars.""  (But mainly because we craved cupcakes.)  We were not disappointed and bought some to take to the airport and enjoyed them on our way home!!

The staff member that helped my friend and I as we picked our cupcakes was extremely kind and helpful.  She was patient as we chose our flavors--which is hard with so many good choices!!  She also helped me pick out a t-shirt, so I can represent Crushcakes on the east coast.  She actually climbed up on the counter to take one down off the wall and ensured that I thought it was the appropriate size before ringing me up.  I was really impressed by her kindness and willingness to help!

I've been coming to Crushcakes for the occasional confection over the last 10 or so years. Ever since moving to downtown SB, this spot has become a new favorite of mine. 

I'm a big proponent of their cinnamon rolls! Not what one would think of ordering from a place that specializes in cupcakes, but surely worth it! Fresh and fluffy, it features a large spreading of the same vanilla bean frosting used on the cupcakes. A roll is big enough for two, too. Yum! 

I also appreciate how Crushcakes makes Bulletproof coffee. It's not an item you see often, but this spot does it well. 

The location is quaint and nicely decorated, though no private parking lot is available. The ladies running the front end are always sweet and friendly, but I can tell that they often get lost in translation with each other. It's not a huge deal, but I've noticed that it typically prevents customers from proceeding in line smoothly. 

Speaking of lines, do try and come early. The front room gets rather backed up with customers after 9am, and is not engineered well to handle a queue of more than two people. I know there aren't many options when working with an old building, but I'd seriously consider re-organizing the way customers are supposed to line up. It prevents confusion and allows for a more seamless customer experience. 

I look forward to coming back again soon, but will be sure to beat the crowd next time!",2018-04-01 17:45:04

If you are just stopping in to get baked goods from the counter, it's 5 stars all the way.  Every time we go there we get handed multiple samples of delicious items by very friendly staff.  You'll wish you had a second stomach.  If you leave Andersen's without getting the Butter Ring, you've made a huge mistake.  It's one of the best things we've ever eaten anywhere.

My second opinion of Andersen's is of the restaurant.  First, it's really charming and it feels like you've taken a step back in time to a cafe in Europe.  I had brunch with my husband and 2 other couples at Andersen's a couple years ago and while the food was good, it wasn't mind blowing like the baked goods.  The main problem was that the service was slow.  Pleasant enough, but slow.  If you're just coming in to sit down and get dessert though, it's fine.

cLiOxny9AFFH4tiBINloNQ,MOPA8zKFx0YZQz3T4speyA,YrNtBUOUOYwmRZ_UVwH8iQ,4,5,4,0,"I can't stop thinking about something I ate at D'Angelo's last summer that was completely out of character for me and unbelievably sumptuous. Worse, I'm not sure how I would go about recreating the recipe for the next several months of breakfasts at home until I get sick of it and never have to think about it again, so I'm doomed to be trapped in this obsessive vicious cycle: ""Want Sunrise Surprise, can't make it to stop thinking about it...Want Sunrise Surprise...""

Strangely, ""Sunrise Surprise"" sounds like something bad that happens to you when you share tents in Boy Scouts rather than a delectable breakfast that you also struggle with striking from your memory. Yet this denizen of deliciousness is surprisingly simple: a thick slice of cakey brioche soaked in milk, dipped in egg on one side, pan-fried on both at just the right temperature for just the right amount of time, and topped with a poached egg. How can something so easy to prepare be so respectable, chef-to-chef?

Perhaps it is the terroir present in the copious amounts of butter that the French toast is cooked in. Maybe it has something to do with the syrup: I had the hardest time discerning what percentage was pure maple, and what percentage was pancake syrup. Maybe it was that the brioche tasted spongy, as if cake flour were part of the dough. All I know is that I was having the worst time trying to work up an appetite that morning, and I left the place with my eyes as wide as dinner plates and my stomach stuffed like I ate Jonah Hill. My wife couldn't stop talking about the Sunrise Surprise (her SECOND of the day, mind you) for the next week, either.

The Eggs Rose the wife ordered were excellent and served in the same Spartan way as the Sunrise Surprise (without flourish, with only excellent ingredients), and if I loved salt the way my wife does, I would have loved that menu item. I just felt that on kalamata olive bread the artichoke paste became a tad overpowering for my mood that morning. Everyone seems to like the dish on Yelp, however, and I'm usually a sucker for twists on the eggs Benedict, which this basically is. For full disclosure purposes, I also prefer olives in rather restricted environments, like Greek salads, martinis, some soft breads, marinated, on their own, in giardinera or a muffuletta, or in ropa vieja or picadillo. Yep, I have an olive pecadillo that has something to do with picadillo. 

The breads at D'Angelo's (it is a bakery after all) looked particularly exquisite, with more thoughtful ingredient combinations than your run-of-the-mill independent bakery, and the crusty breads on their menu all seemed to have a good amount of ""chew,"" making their loaves the opposite of the ultrarefined crap you find in the supermarket bakery. I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of breakfast meats on the menu to provide a hearty, protein-rich start to my day, but this certainly didn't hurt my gout any. It's not America's fault that what I think passes for breakfast is usually richer and less loaded with carbohydrates than most of my countryfolk expect. All that ""continental"" crap from the Old Country ruined breakfast: the meal where you're supposed to kick your metabolism into high gear by eating many cuts of pork or other type of largeish mammal. (According to the ""Eat This, Not That""--the gimmick for people who refuse to support local economies when they go out to dine--one bagel is as bad for you as 20 strips of bacon, so go for the bacon!)

So while I would like to see sliced rare prime rib or menudo lurking somewhere during brunch at D'Angelo's, this place is a bakery, not a carneceria. And the kind of bakery D'Angelo's is is extremely important, because no bread available in anything other than a bakery like this one seems to have any chew anymore. Everywhere I go, good bread is an endangered species. Even the par-baked stuff at Trader Joe's uses flour that is too refined. With ""whole grain"" on the label meaning absolutely nothing these days, I haven't found a store brand that makes for respectable anything--except bread crumbs--in the last 2 years. I'm so done with the whole thing that I've gone back to baking my own bread.

So this makes D'Angelo's an endangered species. The only place left that has bread with nutritional value, texture, and flavor. We have to patronize these kinds of places before we all die of diabetes. Children need to grow up knowing what real bread tastes like. Run from the Bimbo Bear.

Oh, and after a little research, this is a good brioche recipe ( http://www.latartinegourmande.com/2007/04/02/simplest-brioche-la-plus-simple-des-brioches/ ) for making your own Sunrise Surprise. You might need to add a little flour to the dough to get it to a point where it just sticks to your fingers without leaving any residue behind. Bake, slice, soak slice in beaten egg on one side, load the skillet with butter, fry on bread side, fry on egg side, top with poached egg. Isn't ""Bon appetit"" French for ""Fuck yeah""?",2012-03-21 19:04:24

I went back a year later and got a dozen to bring home to my family, all different flavors of course!

The cupcakes were good, but not as amazing as my first experience.  They do tend to run a little bit dry, and some were a little too sweet.

When I come back I think I'll stick to more exciting flavors.  I loved the moistness of the cherry coke cupcake!

They did the wedding cake for my daughter's destination wedding in October 2013 and we couldn't have been happier! The cake was absolutely beautiful...but more importantly delicious! Many of our guests said it was the best wedding cake they had ever eaten, and I would definitely agree.Their staff  went out of their way to accommodate us. In addition to the wedding cake, they also created a groom's cake, Rice Krispies fleur di lis cake ( bride and groom met and currently reside in New Orleans), a 1/4 sheet cake and also a round cake.Each and every cake was delicious and we couldn't have been happier! This baker and his staff will go the extra mile for you.It was important for me to surprise my daughter and her husband with the Rice Krispie treat fleur di lis cake and although they don't normally make this type of cake, they found a pan on the Internet, did a trial run and made the cake for us.It was a great surprise for the Bride and Groom, and a great addition to our sweet table.

I was just about to go eat lunch so I was only going to get something if it totally leapt out and forced me to, and I got REALLY close but in the end was able to control myself and left without a purchase.  The woman behind the counter was cheerful and friendly.  She greeted me and asked if she could help me and offered me a tiny-bite-sized sample of their apple pie.  The pie was good, though not so fantastic I had to have one before leaving the store.  What looked totally incredible though were the croissants.  I nearly did buy some of those.  The almond croissants, for example, had a sugary paste on the outside that kept the large number of almond slivers on and I wanted to eat that so badly.  The chocolate croissants were perfectly formed and baked with just a bit of browning to them that made them look phenomenal.

They have so many flavors and they are just lovely~ I would recommend buying the boxed set if you plan on buying more than 5 because you save money buying them.

I haven't had any of their other pastries, but I hear good things about the Croque Madame.  

It's very small inside, maybe only 10 people max can fit inside, it's more of a grab and go kind of place. The staff is super friendly and sweet too which is a plus~ Watch out for their early closing times though on weekends I made that mistake before and missed them when they were already closed.

W7QDo8-NpyHx6Q4Vp-4VJw,wimsduueha3v-hTTsMGb5w,XgehM3pBZWuXi45J2dqRJQ,4,1,0,0,"As a disclaimer, I'm not vegan and I often don't like vegan foods, such as vegan cheeses. For example, I've been to the vegan restaurant on the Mesa twice and thought it was awful both times. But I did think Boochies was pretty good.

To start, I got the kids brain boost smoothie. No, I'm not a kid, but it sounded good and it was delicious! More the consistency of fresh pressed juice than thick like a smoothie, but still delicious flavor. However, at nine bucks it's pricier even than lazy acres, and the kids drink is just 12 oz. Despite the hefty price tag, I could see this drink becoming an addiction.

I also wanted food and I ended up getting the pizza, which happens not to be vegan because it has goat cheese, but of course that didn't bother me as I'm not vegan. 
The pros: The pizza had a really good flavor; I tasted plenty of garlic and seemingly fresh tomatoes plus the goat cheese and olives added some saltiness. I also liked the crumbled falafel or whatever was on top. Hearty and tasty. 
The cons: The consistency was odd. I've have plenty of cauliflower crusts before, and I like them, but something on this was mushy. I'm not sure if it was the crust or the ""almond sauce,"" but unlike the smoothie, I probably won't get this again. One other minor con is that everything appeared to be premade. The pizza, along with a spinach thing and Mac n cheese, were sitting in a little warming oven / display on the front counter. It reminded me of hot dogs in a gas station. This is definitely nothing like a gas station - at all- but I do prefer my food to be made to order. It's not that kind of place though, I guess, which does make it easy for a quick, healthy lunch. 

As for the cafe itself, it's very cute and has plenty of table space. A lovely, convenient, relaxing place for lunch or snack. 

In sum, I'll definitely be back for the smoothies and to try the desserts and probably the veggie burger, and I would definitely recommend this place to others.",2015-07-28 20:50:22

I love visiting bakeries, but not usually for the bread-y, cake-y or pastry options. I usually hope they have some kind of chocolate mousse or a good-looking cookie or brownie. I began that search at this place. The young man behind the counter wanted to be helpful and started offering samples of all the things I would never choose. Something called a Buttering with marzipan and later a fruit torte. The Buttering looked like an enormous Cheese danish, which has never been my thing - carbs that taste stale and lack the artistry and sweetness I crave. And marzipan? That dense, overly-sweet stuff that's used for making cake toppers?? Yeah, there was no way I was gonna like that. HOW WRONG I WAS! This pastry was absolute perfect. The marzipan was light in texture - like a cheesecake. It wasn't overly sweet. And the pastry itself was light, sweet and moist from absorbing a little of the marzipan. If I lived here, I would plan brunches all the time just so I could buy one of these to set out. 

The fruit tart was nice as well! The cream had just enough sweetness to balance the fruit on top. And the fruit didn't have that obnoxious layer of sugary goo painted on top. 

Hubby is a huge fan of pastries and a huge fan of apples, so we also got a slice of apple strudel (currant special). I'm not usually crazy about these either. But again, the pastry was impressive and the apples inside were perfection. They didn't taste like they came from a fan but had been baked, sugared and seasoned to perfection!

Simply buying two pieces ran around $12. I feel this is on the expensive side, but I also feel it was totally worth it. Great service with out of this world artistry of texture and flavor.",2017-04-27 17:40:36

So, this was my plan: split the eggs rose & waffle with my friend. GREAT CHOICE!
First off - it's nice to balance the sweet waffle with the salty eggs rose.

Here's when I knew I was in for something good ...
The waitress asked if I wanted my poached eggs cooked soft, medium or hard. OMG! I was in heaven because I always ask for my poached eggs medium and they are NEVER medium. It's like they can only be completely runny or hard as a rock. okay - enough babble.

anyway, I asked for medium and it came cooked perfectly! 

Word to the wise: Do NOT put salt on your eggs - the spread is salty enough.

The Eggs Rose was perfect - salty, tasty, flavorful - wonderful. And then when I needed a break from the salt I would grab a bite of the perfectly delectable waffle (nice and thin without being too crunchy).

The berries were delicate and refreshing. The cake was delivered on time as promised. I am very impressed with this bakery. The quality and value can't be beat.

Otherwise this was the best breakfast we've had in a long time.  I had the breakfast sandwich on the croissant, huge portion and delicious.  My wife had banana crepes on special, these were not as sweet as we expected and also very tasty.  

Order the orange juice!  At $3.25 it comes in a pint glass and is fresh squeezed and super delicious!

The nicest part was as we waited for our food a plate was delivered with samples of bread and pastries from the bakery.  Not only were the samples AMAZING (made me think I should just eat pastries for breakfast!) but there was enough food on the plate to warrant ordering less food.   And it was complimentary, which was really nice!  

The price was high for breakfast, over $50 for 2 of us with tip, but we ate so well and left so full that we skipped lunch!  So that justifies the cost, right?!

It's right on the corner, so you can't miss it. Walk in, and you're in the cupcakery, but go right up the ramp and find yourself in their cafe area. There's little table scattered around the cafe and on days when it isn't rainy, it's really nice to sit at their patio tables that surround the outside. They are pet-friendly too. You place your order, grab your utensils and condiments (check out their homey abundance of sauces, it feels like you're digging in your pantry for your faves) and then grab a little table. Really like the simplicity of their wraps and breakfast sandwiches, but on at least one leg of my round trip drive, I get the Red Velvet Pancakes with a Mexican Hot Chocolate. On my last trip up, I brought my cousin with me. As she took a bite of my Pancakes, she was describing how much she liked them, and as we went over and over all of the awesome words that could describe my yummy breakfast, the word I had in my head was Pan-Cup. The delightful texture of a pancake, with the deliciousness of a cupcake. They serve it with fresh strawberry and banana slices, with a flowered butter pat and a side of their sour cream frosting, as well as the syrup. Skip the syrup. The pancakes stand well on their own. And the mexican hot chocolate? Rich, smooth, and absolutely without the graininess I fail to conquer with my at home attempts. The people are always laid back and friendly, they are happy to describe ingredients if you feel clueless. Oh, and the cupcakes?

To start off, the coffee was wonderful and full-bodied.  Every time the server came by, I made it a point to make sure my cup was full.  My order was a dish called Eggs Rose, which was described so well by Elizabeth B.  The description sounded delicious and the actual meal was a wonderful treat for the palate.  Poached eggs perched atop an artichoke spread over toasted olive bread.  Mmm.

Our morning venture to D'Angelos has happily broken the curse.  Cappuccinos with delicate foam reminiscent of a run down Beaver Creek, coffee so deeply rich it will trick your taste-buds into thinking you're back in the Pacific Northwest, and I've got only one hyphenated word for the food: bomb-diggity.   

The lox plate with pain de siegle (French Rye bread) shares its plate with SB farmer's market-fresh Heirloom tomatoes, crisp red onion circles and lusciously salty capers.  Delish.  Ditto goes for the spinach, fontina and caramelized onion omelette--a simple, gooey masterpiece.  Def go for a side of pancetta--it comes perfectly fried and all curled up like a little cinnamon roll of fatty pig.  Mmmmmm....I'll have that.

Tri-tip seared with shallots, garlic, parsley and topped with melted aged Gruyere cheese on a homemade soft roll. I also got a coffee you can see in the background.

The only downside is because of the cheese it was a very heavy sandwich so I was full for awhile afterwards. 

Macarons. Pistachio (Green), Coffee (Tan), Raspberry (Pink), Chocolate (Brown). Delicious! I usually don't like almond flavored things but these were really good, just the right amount of flavoring mixed with almond equals chewy delicious goodness.

The recipes have been checked, tasted and modified till perfection is reached.
By eating good hand-made products, you eat healthy.
Whatever sandwich you get there, it comes with arugula, a handmade vinaigrette, and some more ingredients cleverly selected for their taste.
And what about their loaf ? You will want it every morning once tried, with butter and jam... or in sandwiches.... they make their croque-monsieur with it !

The second time I went, I happened to be there at the perfect time, because the crossants just came out of the oven, and they were freshly warm!  I nearly cried of uber excitement over the crossants because I finally found a place that reminded me of France!

Not only are their pastries to die for, but also their coffee!  I've had their cappuccino and latte...  No other place can compare to how they pour the right amount of espresso and millk to perfection!  I love my lattes tasting more on the espresso side and they made it happen!

I came to this location after reading a few mixed reviews (complaints) but knowing vegan friendly restaurants are highly criticized especially since a lot of vegans have grown to be very opinionated as it is, but I personally was very pleased and delighted at the consistency flavor and  size of my food! I am a frequent patron at vegan eateries around the country and am doing my best to shed some light on them without bias. F you frequent these types of places the prices are usually not expensive but are not typically filler menu status... this is not fast food or your standard food service preparation and production of this type of food is a bit more labor intensive and fresh food does expire. This being said expect any vegan/vegetarian food that requires preparation to cost slightly more then a combo meal. 

Im from LA were sometimes vegan cuisine is unfortunately confused for a status choice and not a personal decision for well being of ourselves and other life! 
 
Over all prices are average. 
Food really tasty.
I had a:
Vegan mint fudge ball-great!
Vegan Kale salad- clean tasty simple big enough to share if you are gonna order the entree too
Vegan eggplant parmigiana- really delicious and deff add the marinara!
The free pineapple water is a nice touch too

It's a nice, quaint little cafe, and it wasn't too busy on a Sunday morning. It felt like a good spot to go and be lazy for the day, but I imagine that's most of Santa Barbara. It's self seating and my waitress was very friendly and attentive. I kept it simple as I was going on 3 hours of sleep after a bender the night before. 

I had a cup of large coffee and New York Fried Egg Sandwich with extra ham on it. The eggs and ham were nothing spectacular as it's just eggs and ham.

The cake was moist and tender, enjoyed the cinnamon swirl inside though it brought the cake into muffin territory.  The frosting was rich and thick, too sweet but still delicious.  It wasn't as cinnamony as I expected but I appreciated the restraint.

I'm a huge almond croissant, macaron, pastries fan. I've had my share of good, terrible and a few excellent almond croissants.  While I'd say Renaud's almond croissant was very good, I wouldn't say it was the best I've had.  The almond topping on the croissant was really tasty, sweet almost candied almonds on top.  But the filling didn't have enough almond paste flavor to satisfy me.  The croissant itself was very good though, flaky, buttery, melts in your mouth (I also had a plain croissant which was very good)

Being from the bay area, I think that La Boulange Bay Bread (I usually go to the one on fillmore or get them at farmer's markets on the peninsula) have the Best almond croissant.  The almond filling has such a delicious and satisfying taste of almond paste and almond, really flavorful.

But back to Renaud's.  I also got a Ladybug birthday cake for my mother inlaw, it's a pistachio sponge cake with strawberries and cream. It was good but not excellent. I couldn't really taste the pistachio in the cake. I also got an individual size of the chocolate hazelnut cake which was pretty good, but a little bit dry.

I also got a bunch of flavors of macaron- chocolate, pistachio, raspberry, hazelnut.  There are quite a few still sitting on my counter from last weekend so I can only say they were ok, very sweet and not quite the texture I remember in the macarons I like.  Oh and I also tried the canneles but have to say that again, I prefer the bay bread ones.

Overall I'd say Renaud's is 3.5-4 *.  It's quite good, maybe in SB it's the best patisserie in the area.  But based on my experience, not the best I've had ever.

Go again?  Yes, if I was in SB, I would probably go again and get the almond croissant or plain croissant or maybe try chocolate.  I did enjoy it and thought the croissant pastry was pretty good.",2009-09-13 05:21:08

It's cute, cozy, and quaint with some tables outside so your furry pal can join you.  There was a steady stream of customers while we were there.  The owners were incredibly sweet and you could tell customer satisfaction was a priority.

Mr. and I split the Eggs & Bacon and Croque Madam.  We got a side of potatoes with one and a salad with the other.  The Eggs & Bacon, delish.  The Croque Madam, even more delish.  

Now, here's where a bit of constructive criticism comes in.  Both sandwiches were lukewarm (not a big deal, but I noticed).  The potatoes were just one little hashbrown patty similar to the McD's variety.  The salad was fresh and dressing was good, but a garnish-like portion.  Mr. and I were both starrrrving and we were like, this is cute.  Now where's the rest of it?  We weren't expecting the dishes to be so dainty, especially after forking out $11 a pop.

The food was also great.  I got the red velvet pancakes and my bf got a sandwich (eeks, cant remember which one!).  Presentation was great and the food was delish!

It wasn't a long wait though, & a wait time for a party of one is good. That means you do good business in my opinion. It's set up as an open kitchen, so you can see stacks of spices, large steaming pots, and whirring machines baking, cleaning, and doing whatever they do. My favorite thing was seeing a cook molest a big pan of potatoes with oil and salt... to a food whore like me, that's about as sexy as spying on your neighbors while they get down. 

I literally stood there with my tongue out watching him, like ""yeah baby...get those taters...mmmm, yeah... rub that oil and salt...just like that"".. then I caught myself. Still hot and bothered I took my seat. I ordered something called the sunrise surprise. French toast with a poached egg. Honestly, it was the best French toast EVER! Thick brioche. Nice visible egg coating...but didn't taste like egg. It was wonderful. I ordered my poached egg medium, but it came hard. Not a biggie, but I wished I had a little yolk run off. 

I also had a hot mocha, which came quite strong. I'm more on the team of mocha= hot chocolate with a splash of coffee. I didn't finish it, as I'm not a coffee girl. (Don't judge me!) I would give 5 stars, but it was a bit pricey. An egg, 1 slice of French toast, and a mocha shouldn't be $20 in my opinion. Throw a side salad, a sausage (they don't have sausage here. I recommend getting chicken sausage in your restaurant immediately. Not everyone wants bacon bitches.) Or maybe some sauteed mushrooms. Throw me some side for that price. C'mon. Don't be stingy.

Back to the food porn for a min. People were staring at me when I turned to take my seat. Lol, so I MUST have been salivating while looking at the open kitchen.

Honestly it took me a while to stray away from the first cake I ever head, the peace cake, it's so simple, yet so satisfying. Once I was able to step out of the delicious trans this cupcake put me into I decided I would give the chocolate peanut butter one a try. One of the best decisions of my life tbh. I really don't think you can go wrong with the cupcakes at crush cakes. 

The Food Though!

Yeah on top of their delicious baked treats, they also serve up intelligentsia coffee and have a pretty decent sized menu of really hearty meals such as wraps, soups, and sandwiches. While I am not a huge fan of the tomato bisque I am addicted to the BLT Turkey wrap. Really filling and really delicious.

Besides being the busiest restaurant on the block, it was decorated with old world, English, antique furniture, kind of like a old Victorian home. It came off as pleasant and comforting. 

Food: Danish/Sweedish/Norweigen: This place was a nice change from all the ""commercialized"" choices we have in Irvine. They start off by serving you a plate of fresh Italian bread and butter and some samplings of their hot coconut, almond, apple danish. ((The danish was delicious) 

Ordered: Eggs Benedict, Lemon Pancakes, Quiche with pickled cucumber salad. 

**Everything was fantastic! The bacon that came with the pancakes was sweet like brown sugar and crispy. Just the way I like it. My quiche was filled with cheese and spinach and had a flaky pastry crust. The eggs Benedict has a wonderful hollandaise sauce on top that was entirely different then what I thought ""traditional"" hollandaise should taste like. It was so much lighter tasting and much more milky. The pancakes had just a hint of lemon, but was just enough to balance out the sweetness from the syrup.

My only complaint is that they didn't craft a very good latte. Peet's Coffee is down the street if you want a better cup of Joe - but this place is famous for pastries not coffee. 

Also, the payment process is a bit tacky. After  you hand over your credit card they put a computer monitor in your face which states the total along with huge buttons that gives you options to tip various  percentages. Funny considering how French people are known to be cheap tippers in the U.S.

Crushcakes makes regulars cakes (in addition to their cupped cousins), so I requested a 6"" red velvet with sour cream frosting.  It was a nice deal at $25, but I needed it delivered to the Four Seasons (charge was $15 since it was in Montecito; it is only $10 within Santa Barbara).  Paxton was the gal who took my order over the phone and had to deal with my constant re-checking of the order details (""FOUR PEEEEE-EMMMMMMM delivery, PUH-LEASE!  DO NOT deliver it earlier!!!"").  The order was placed on a Tuesday and the delivery was set for Saturday.

On Friday, I got a confirming call from another gal in the bakery.  That made me really happy!!  They were clearly working to make sure my order was going to be as I requested.

Saturday night, the cake arrived by the time I checked in with the concierge (at 6:15-ish) and when it came time for the big reveal, it looked awesome!  BUT THE TASTE WAS DIVINE!  

We are talking 2 cake layers of moist red velvet and a middle layer and top layer of the frosting (which tasted like cream cheese frosting and was a tad sweeter than what I like)!   It was such a nice cap to our meal and everyone in the party was pleased about the cake.

You can order from the mains and dine-in menu, but you will not be able to resist a pastry on the side. The croissants are the best in Santa Barbara and we are truly spoiled to have them. Nothing mushy and puffy about them, they are flakey and crisp on the outside, perfect for a quick dip in the cappuccino or some hot chocolate. Just make sure it's good hot chocolate or you will do your croissant a grave disservice. 

They have a great Axxess deal: first use is buy one entree get one free. Purchases afterwards are 10% off.  We used the bogo today for our toasted croissant breakfast sandwich and croque monsieur. So good. Each came with a choice of salad or cup of fruit.  And of course we got a pastry to nibble on while waiting for our hot food.

Macarons are smaller than when they first opened, but they are also now half the price, about 95 cents. I like this new size, it's a perfect little mouthful.

My favorite dishes are the egg, ham, & cheese croissant with potatoes on the side. AND I also love their omelets because gruyere cheese is one of the most spectacular foods on planet Earth. 
For lunch, the Renaud's salad is my go-to. If I want a sandwich, I'll go with the oven-roasted chicken sandwich with a small side salad.

Their coffee is pretty good, but the presentation of the coffee makes it taste even better. 

Of course they are known for their croissants, and I suppose I'm yet another one of the million people that is head-over-heels for the almond croissant. It's unbeatable, especially if you get there early in the morning when they are piping hot and fresh from the oven. 
If you aren't feeling up to the task of a heavy croissant, their salted caramel macarons will give you the satisfaction of a salty-sweet lighter treat.

The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I loved the French decor and sitting in front of the pastry counter was very tempting haha!

My friend and I split the two eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes which was really good and the perfect amount of food to share between two people. I had read other yelp reviews saying that the almond croissants were amazing so we also split that. It was SO delicious and definitely balanced our savory breakfast. 

My sister got the pumpkin spice latte which had just the right amount of pumpkin and spice... perfect for fall! Yum! My nephews ordered the French toast which I tried and man were they good! They were thick and fluffy but not overly sweet.

I would definitely recommend Renaud's to anyone who wants to eat some yummy French food for breakfast.

Staff was johnny-on-the-spot, especially Caleb, who when we returned for late afternoon tea remembered we had been there 8 hours earlier.  Service is attentive and friendly.
That coffee was out of this world, as was the Strawberry cake we shared at 5pm.

We had a sample of the Black Jack cake and wow was that something... so you know when I say I am coming back this is part of the dessert.

I wish I had more on my plate but only because I'm greedy, nothing to do with portion size vs cost. I think that $9 for a super healthy lunch made with all organic ingredients is way worth the money. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to recommended their favorite dishes to me since it was my first time. I felt good about that! 

I have eaten at Mesa Verde (a vegan, gf restaurant in town) a few times and have always found that their food lacks flavor. My burger at the Green Table was so tasty that I can't wait to go back and try all of the other items on the menu! I'm looking forward to trying the lasagne!!

They should stay open till 3PM for what few Jappy moms exist in San Roque (SB is not very Jewish, which Dad would call understatement of the century) and don't cook and thus need a good lunch before they swing by Gelson's for groceries. 

I need to organize and order lunch to be picked up then (if I call at 2:15 the gruyere sandwich will be fine or else they or I can nuke it). 

I love the pistachio truffles--and I'm not a chocolate person by any means--as well as the macaroons in various flavors.

We also had the Croque Monsieur with ham. ""Béchamel sauce, Swiss cheese and choice of ham or sautéed mushrooms on homemade pain de mie.""  One word: BUTTER.  But in the good way.  Like the ""omg, how is this so good?"" way.

For dessert, I ordered one of each french macaroon (or macaron): chocolate, caramel (dulce de leche), coffee, coconut, pistachio, raspberry.

The macarons were absolutely perfect.  They had a thin shell that crumbles into itself when you take a bite.  Once your teeth have broken the shell, the chewy meringue pillow catches your fall and the taste of the delicate, sweet syrup center makes you go ""mmmm"".",2010-11-08 22:50:35

I really wanted to try their Croque Madame (fried egg over a grilled ham and cheese).

They have many great flavors -- salted-caramel, chocolate, hazelnut, coffee, pistachio, passionfruit, strawberry, coconut and vanilla. I can say unequivocally that these are some of the best French macarons I've ever tasted.

These cream-filled cookies will fill your soul with a warm and fuzzy excitement as you bite into their smooth, light 'n creamy filling and soft and smooth wafer-like casing. Some might balk at the $1.75 price tag but one taste will banish any doubts.

I bring literally everyone who visits me in Santa Barbara and everyone is equally amazed. This place is so good. It is small but service is fast so you shouldn't worry about finding a place to sit. I've come here with a group as big as seven without a problem. More might be a little sticky.

I can't bring myself to order anything but a croque madame, but I've tried the beef sandwich, grilled cheese, quiche, and some other menu items and they were all bomb. The orange juice is also fresh-squeezed and very good and they have real sugar Mexican cokes. 

However, the croque madame is absolutely perfect. They make the bread, and you can tell that the ham is fresh sliced. The béchamel is light and they never overcook the egg yolk, it always runs over everything beautifully.

Get an almond croissant. I don't even really like croissants (sorry if that is offensive, people get really protective of their love of croissants) but this one is incredible. It's not too sweet, incredibly moist, and most often warm.

Another thing that left me absolutely shocked was the fact that their artistic-looking dessert pastries actually taste good. I haven't ordered a pastry like that for probably five years (and I'm 19 years old) because they always look good but taste like a mixture of cardboard and crisco, but my roommate got a little sculpture of a tart and it tasted amazing. DAMN CUDOS.

The only negative things I would add are that the salad that comes with everything is really plain. and they don't have a pepper grinder. I keep a pepper grinder in my purse which always gets me my pepper along with some laughs, so I guess it's forgivable.",2011-05-23 06:10:38

XgnmXQOeaHzHfdQrj7sWyQ,qunxFdBDVl0ordRJEPVNtQ,UuRZpgZsHX7PyykHV3wbZg,4,6,3,3,"Cake mixes out of a box are so cheap and easy these days that I've almost forgotten what it's like to have some good cake made from scratch.
Those few times I have, I am initially taken aback by the lack of ""moistness,"" and then I realize that moistness is not necessarily a good thing. The moistness of box mix...isn't that from the oil that was added to the batter? 
With that background, I find myself rather pleased with Crushcakes. The cake is not cloyingly sweet and it doesn't leave an grease spot when I set it down on a paper napkin.  The frosting adds the sweet balance.
The cupcakes are very cute, especially the mini ones, I think I like those best. A little mouthful of happiness. 
I was walking downtown this evening and noticed the Crushcakes door was open, this caught me by surprise as I'd heard they closed early in the day or whenever they ran out of cupcakes. I scooted right inside that door and was greeted by friendly staff. I picked out a regular sized lemon drop cupcake and a buttermilk crumb thingie, and then a mini cupcake of the lemon drop and red velvet. Did I mention that the mini ones are really really cute? 
I liked the denseness of the cupcake, and the flavor. Again, NOT moist/greasy. I think they go well with tea or punch. 

I am super pleased that more bakeries and confectioneries are opening up in town, especially locally owned ones.  So rah-rah for Crushcakes! 

Note to folks who want to buy lots, like a dozen or two: please please order ahead of time, so the staff can get a better sense of how many to make that day.  When they sell out early, it's usually because a customer unexpectedly swooped up a bunch.",2008-03-05 06:10:59

I ordered the Blackstone eggs Benedict which was a special that included two poached eggs over tomatoes and bacon, on a French baguette with citrus hollandaise sauce for $19.95. Eggs Benedict is one of my favorite dishes so I like to try it whenever I can.
The egg yolks weren't runny like I asked for, but honestly, not a lot of places can poach eggs without overcooking them, especially because eggs continue to cook one you remove them from heat.
The bacon was nice and crispy, and the bread was phenomenal! They lightly battered the French bread, and it was perfect, along with the citrus hollandaise. I'm not a fan of tomatoes, so I pushed it off to the side, but it looked fresh.
I also ordered a side of oven roasted potatoes, that were a little bland, and not very seasoned. For a $5 side of potatoes, I was expecting something a little more special.
The prices are a bit steep, but I'm usually willing to pay more for excellent food and this was a great meal.
Our waitress was very attentive and polite.

nyYvTkDT3kBVwIsVxua5Lg,zWLhTbc_Q0R2800Q5EPSKw,Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g,4,0,0,0,"Santa Barbara is one of my wife and I's favorite ""spots"" to get away to - even if we don't get to as often as we'd like.  Much of the time we drive right by this lovely town on the way to Solvang (our absolute favorite getaway spot!).  This year on our late Summer vacation we decided to change that.  We were going to Solvang this year to attend our first Danish Days celebration - and decided to add a day in Santa Barbara to our itinerary.

Towards the end of our first evening, trudging away back to the car after a long day of perusing shops; we passed by this lovely little Restaurant/Bakery.  The smells coming from the place were divine; but we were tired after a day's shopping and so I decided it'd be appropriate and fun to have brunch at this Danish-themed cafe before we began the ""Solvang Leg"" of our vacation the next morning.  This became a great decision.  

This cute little eatery has both outdoor and indoor seating.  What's nice about the outdoor seating area is that they have heaters setup that hang down from the ceiling/patio awnings for Santa Barbara's chilly mornings and evenings as opposed to the portable kinds that stand on the ground.  This means the space in the outside seating area, although not very large, is optimized.

Inside, the decor is a lovely blend of Danish and French Country - with some beautiful blue tole-style murals on the walls.  Seating is comfortable and intimate - with an area for larger parties in an upstairs seating area.

Of course - the main reason one goes to a restaurant is the food!  And we were hungry and eager to start our day on a good note.  The menu featured an interesting mix of old world European Breakfast/lunch dishes along with traditional favorites.

Now... people... listen to me here.  This *is* Santa Barbara.  It's a popular tourist spot and its a bit upscale.  The prices of what you find on State Street are going to reflect that.  This being said - the items on the menu were a bit pricey, yes.  This has been mentioned in many of the previous Yelps before me.  But I don't feel anything was outrageous - and from what you'll read in my Yelps and those of others for Andersen's, you quality for your money. 

They also had a big case of pastries that would challenge even Mortensen's in Solvang in quality and variety.  The wife decided to enjoy a couple choice pastries; while I ordered a Monte Cristo Breakfast Sandwich bacon and eggs on the side.  Wifey's pastries were good sized, and she thought they were scrumptious, and I absolutely loved my Monte Cristo.  The raspberry jam I dipped it in was handmade and utterly delicious.  Even the bacon, thick and applewood smoked, was nummy!

The service was great as well.  Our waiter, Kyle, was very friendly and attentive.  He made some good suggestions and was very informative on various items on the menu.  

Overall - we were very impressed with Andersen's and will certainly return again to explore their menu further.  I give it 4 solid stars - reserving awarding it a 5th until we've had a chance to see what their dinner fare is like.  If dinner is anything like their breakfasts - I'm sure a 5th star will easily come.  Stay tuned!  And certainly give Andersen's a try!",2011-09-23 02:46:46

We wanted to walk around and check out some places on State St. for dinner. We were immediately taken by the uniqueness of the menu. You can always expect a place to have ""California"" cuisine or Italian or something but Danish? Really? And they had happy hour on a Sunday!

We plopped ourselves down outside and were greeted by a lovely lady whom assume owns the place by her accent. We ordered two glasses of wine off the happy hour list which came with a crostini each. Oh heaven. The crostini had a base of a sweet creamy cheese and then very garlicy tomato, onion and basil. I wanted about eight more. We ordered two appetizers that were half off, the crab cake and the baked Brie. I am still dreaming of this crab cake. It was that good. Holy cow. 

For dinner we shared then Jaeger Schnitzel. It was delicious. The mushroom sauce was out of this world. The potato it came with was a little lacking. It was just a whole potato and pretty dry. But there was enough sauce to dip the potato in which was nice. It was just the right amount of food. We skipped dessert even though it looked so good just because we had to get on our way.

""Everybody has got a sweet tooth!"" I must admit I was a bit grumpy when she said that and didn't want to reveal I have a sweet tooth since my sweet tooth was in great pain that day. Yes, I DO have a sweet tooth but that day my tooth was really really aching so I was walking around trying to pretend I could go a day without chewing. Trying anyway, but this lady reminded me I love sweets so I broke down and gladly tried a piece of the raspberry pastry she handed us. It was really good. My friend felt it was too sweet. I loved it. MMMM sweet!!!!

We also got to try a piece of their marzipan cake. It was really good. I just love places that know that giving samples not only wins them customers from sheer kindness but also from showing people their stuff is good. A place that offers free samples is most often a place that knows their stuff is good. All the while I was deciding to get a pastry for myself the lady was with us and she had a particularly pleasant way to get us to buy stuff. The other lady that came by was equally as pleasant and they worked well together in trying to get us to get into the pastry mood. Scandinavians are known for being very pleasant and down to earth. I love this place.

The only con was that they have rather poor chai lattes here. Here they plop a tea bag into hot water and then add milk. My friend did not like her chai. I could not believe they served that kind of chai. Everywhere else they use syrup instead of a tea bag including the best places I have had chai at.

We chatted a bit and he told me that he is from Marseilles : a seaside town in France best known for seafood, Bouillabaisse, Fanny and the Maurice Chevalier movie.
A Chooket is a pate choux concoction with various fillings as in a mini cream puff. This ""Chooket"" is beginning to be an addiction. It happens.
Along with picking up the bd cake I bought a couple of Matthieu's Brownies.
Since we were not to carve up the BD cake until later in the afternoon we glommed onto the very subtly chocolate...chocolate brownies. They were pretty much a revelation: dusted with very high quality cocoa and produced with a minimum of sugar and a maximum of high quality chocolate. Very French, very delicious. Very, Very good stuff, Monsieur Matthieu!
The flavor and toppings for my sister's bd cake were her choice as we usually do chocolate but god forgive her...she is not a chocolate fan. (yes, she is in our prayers daily)
The actual cake was white with an undercurrent of nuts as in almonds, pecans. The frosting and between the layers was whipped cream but one that was slightly sweet and not the overly stabilized whipped that you usually get when you order a whipped cream cake. In any event this was good stuff.
This cake also had strawberry topping as well strawberries in the filling.
In regards to the white cake and the chocolate cake we bought last December: both were slightly over baked with the white cake less so. Both were slightly dry and the texture was not as i like: crumbly, moist and basically falls apart (in a good way) in your mouth.

I was looking for a brunch spot in SB and I came across Renaud's. It's located next to Gelson's and it wasn't hard to spot since there's tons of people eating outside. Renaud's has a great European flair to it. First, you walk in and order and then you find yourself a table. Their display case is FULL of tasty treats from various pastries to macarons. I decided on getting their Fried Egg Sandwich and an Almond Croissant since this is what people have been raving about. I was contemplating on getting macarons, but I figured I'd wait and see how I felt after my meal.

Fried Egg Sandwich is pretty tasty. There isn't really anything special about it, but I thought it was good. The Almond Croissant was another story... instant foodgasm! If you love sweets, you have to try this thing. After every single flaky bite of the croissant was gone, it was macaron time. I really should've gotten one of every single flavor, but I came to my senses. I narrowed it down to two: Passionfruit & Pistachio. You can really tell they were fresh. I loved that! Pistachio tasted like a real pistachio, but Passionfruit was a little too intense for me. Man, I really should've gotten all the flavors, but at $1.75 a piece those things would've gotten expensive.

I wish I knew the recipe of the dill sauce but they won't tell me!!! Happy hour is also the best deal in town... 4 dollar beers and 6 dollar wines? And it comes with a free snack? I swear I can sit here for the whole happy hour  and watch all the freaks walk by.  Best spot to watch people on state.  Service is always excellent but the owner must hire based on looks because everyone who works here is super good looking......,2012-10-01 03:30:23

We got the red velvet pancakes, organic scramble #4, hangover helper, and the chickened out panini. The red velvet pancakes pretty much lived up to the hype at least for me because they had that perfect red chocolate aroma but weren't too sweet. The chickened out sandwich, which came with a salad, was alright, probably not the best panini you'll have; i recommend you get a breakfast option--even if you're a lunch person like me--because crushcake's breakfast seems to generally taste better than their lunch items.

We also ordered two cupcakes, one vanilla and one cookies and cream. The cake was unremarkable but the frosting was delicious. They seem to have some pretty cool seasonal cupcake flavors so check it out if you're in town.",2016-05-30 06:46:04

It was a busy graduation weekend, yet we (and even the party behind us) were seated in less than 2 minutes. The staff seemed honestly joyful and happy to serve and appreciative that we were there. Even before we had a chance to order, a surprise, complimentary plate of bread AND a fluffy cinnamon roll were delivered to our table with a smile. Their gourmet coffees are as good as you could hope for. The menu was creative and exciting - I went for the Croissant French toast with real maple syrup, freshly whipped cream, fresh strawberries and a side of bacon. (Note: only get one side of bacon. The side is huge!) And they did it all to perfection. Not too cooked. Nothing raw. WOW! Our order came out long before we could have thought to make that longing look in the direction of the kitchen. And the manager came by with a friendly checkup on our table.

The restaurant has a small, quaint feel about it (see pics), but actually has a large number of tables to accommodate their well earned popularity. Both indoor and outdoor, even seating upstairs. I honestly wish I lived closer. We'd be back regularly, if only for the delicious Danish pastries on display from their Bakery at the front.

I don't think it's possible to receive a cute little cupcake and not smile, right?  I don't normally get these for myself but it's a great place to get cupcakes for someone's birthday treat (they offer $0.25 cent birthday candles by the register).  At 3 bucks a pop for the biggins it had better be a special treat!  There are several exciting flavors to choose from and I think they may even have one or two varieties of gluten-free cupcakes.  The icing is mile-high so I have to karate chop some of it off to keep my tongue from curling up.

The cafe is pretty awesome.  They have a catching lunch menu with several fresh, healthy options.  So far I've been hooked on the cheesesteaks.  The roast beef is tender and sliced thin and I love that they add sauteed portabella mushrooms and roasted red peppers.  The sandwiches are moderately sized and come with a light and fresh salad with a delicious house balsamic vinaigrette.  The next time I go I'll have to revisit the french dip and make some requests to tweak it a bit.  It comes on toast (which is unacceptable) but the roll the cheesesteak comes with would be the perfect vehicle.  Extra au jous will also be necessary as the amount they give you is insulting as I like to drench mine in da sawze.  It's got a great flavor though so the potential is there.

The size of the joint is modest and it has that comfy grandma's house feel to it.  If the weather is nice I like to get my food to-go and take it a couple blocks down to the park.",2012-04-24 19:03:28

2- The very handsome dessert clerk who's gaze stares right into your soul... He was hard to look away from. I don't know if I was really in the mood for desserts or if I didn't want to let this good looking man down, but whatever it was, it got me to pay $30 worth of sweets.

The pastries are a work of art!  If you are looking for a great gift, you can buy a pastry or cake and it will be wrapped in the most elegant presentation ever!
The only thing is that, since it is so good, once you go once, you will be hooked along with everyone else.  So sometimes it may be hard to get a table when they are busy and the service is a little challenged when that happens.  
All in all, the atmosphere, the friendly service and the food is exceptional and one of the best in SB!",2009-07-03 05:18:02

My friend and I wanted to try pastries, specifically those Danishes with the fruit and cream. Obviously the best place would be a Danish bakery, right? We get there around 45 minutes before closing so a lot of the baked goods aren't there anymore, including the Danishes. So we weren't going to get anything.

The dude at the counter didn't let us go without giving us some generous samples. Even though he was tied up with I'm assuming his boss and carry out orders and people scrambling around him, he still was helpful and fully attentive to us.

I write this as a separate business to Crushcakes Cupcakery, even though the rooms are joined and are under the same ownership.

The hours of CrushCafe are different to the cupcakery next door, and you do business with the two places separately. Hence, a new business entry.

CrushCafe is uber cute. The space is not that big, but bigger than it appears on the outside. There is an adorable wood burning stove in one of the seating areas that I'm very curious to know if it's a proper working one. Bring on the winter!

The menu offers organic and healthy items, and the coffee is Intelligentsia, which I LOVE after spending a little time in Chicago.

Free wi-fi, great for you telecommuters and facebook update fiends. 

I had their quiche, which came with a side salad. Also ordered a lemon poppyseed muffin and a refillable coffee. It came to about $12. Some might find that pricey, but that's what you pay for quality organic products, and I'm happy to pay it.
The menu item names are a little cheesy and granola, like ""chickened out"" and ""tree hugger"", but whatever, it tastes good.
My quiche was rich and custardy. And I rarely order the quiche from menus because most places overbake theirs, leaving them hard and watery. Bleh. This one was lovely. And the side salad was a lot more ample than I was expecting. 

And although ordering and paying is done at the counter, the food is brought out to the table and we got checked up on by the staff several times, and they cleared away dirty dishes while we had a little dishing session of our own. 

I see this as being a total chick hangout. So guys, check it out.",2008-11-09 21:48:13

The chocolate chocolate cupcake was a bit too coffee-y for me. HOWEVER!

The red velvet crushcake was definitely my favorite; the cake was lovely in color, not too sweet, and it was nicely complimented by the frosting.

Con: Wait is overkill sometimes, especially when they're busy. The couple sitting next to me was waiting for their food the whole time. I was able to order my drink and my food, and the couple was still waiting for their food.

The egg and cheese breakfast sandwich (using sourdough brioche) looked deceptively simple, but the eggs were cooked perfectly, soft and buttery. The Gruyere cheese really complemented the eggs, adding the perfect amount of saltiness. This might be my ideal egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, simple yet delicious.

Of the pastries that we tried the kouign-amman was the best. Apparently, it is available only on weekends, decadent being so buttery in a good way with the perfect amount of sweetness. 

The plain croissant looked perfect. It was quite photogenic. But what you'll get is more like a brioche on the inside, as that is what they are aiming to recreate. If you are looking for a flaky crispy typical croissant, this might not be for you. The cinnamon roll was also resplendent with multiple layers around a sweet cinnoman center. If you're looking for a typical American cinnamon roll (e.g., Cinnabon) with its excess of flavors and sweetness, then this might not be for you, as you will find more subtle flavors here.

Since she is Danish, and we were close to the location with the ceremony, I thought it would be a great fit, and we were NOT let down! Charlotte and her family and team are SUPER helpful, flexible, and have insanely delicious food. They greeted us with their famous ""Viking mimosas"" and even custom-made a cake that had our friends' new (Japanese) family crest in dark chocolate on top for her.

I did notice a slight difference between the pastry I tried in late Dec to one in March. As the one first one was a bit more buttery in flavor and crunch. But it was slight. You can notice the slight difference in the photos (inside the croissant)

Roughly based on qualifications to win the most prestigious award for a bakery in France, this is what I'm looking for:
A perfect all-butter croissant, or croissant au beurre should be the right balance of distinct thin flaky layers and a melt-in-your-mouth buttery, a hint of sweet and slightly chewy dough. It should be uniform in shape, cooked until golden and have a slight sheen with a touch of salt. Lastly, it should make a loud crunch as you bite into it leaving crumbs on your face and clothing.

Being a big fan of croissants and somewhat of a autodidact I felt it necessary to do my own research.  A few classes at Le Cordon Bleu Paris to learn how to make them and continue to take many trips to the City of Love visiting all the bakeries famous for croissants. 
I started with shops that had won the highest honor, Best Croissant in Paris (Du Meilleur Croissant Au Beurre A.O.P. de Paris) which only croissants produced using artisanal, hand-made techniques can compete, which narrows the competitors since 80% of croissants in France. It must be made using industrial methods and ingredients. Bakers must use a specific, high-quality butter bearing the Charentes-Poitou A.O.C./A.O.P. label.",2019-04-03 17:29:57

Right before we reached the front of the line, a young woman came out and announced that breakfast was over.  She wasn't particularly nice about it, and the people standing behind us left.  I ordered a chocolate croissant and coffee.

Service at the counter was quick and friendly, I had the veggie wrap (+ gouda) and Rejuvenator, my husband had the burger and Carrrot Bomb. My wrap was delicious, and the cheese is a great touch (it's an add-on, as it's normally vegan).

my experience, Wait for somebody behind the counter to notice you standing patiently and ready and finally recite your order. They will ungraciously toss you a coffee mug and pastry and hand you a table number if you ordered food from the kitchen. They don't seem appreciative of your business or interested in your well being. I was with my old fashioned (conservative) grandfolks and felt stressed that my grandma and I got our almond croissants immediately while my granddad had to wait several minutes for his croissant sandwich. I was shocked that the pastries weren't even offered to be heated up! A heated almond croissant is a world better from a room temp croissant. 

Onto the good. the space is large and spacious and the atmosphere was busy, polite, average noise level...we got in and out in under an hour. I absolutely was shocked that they offer bottomless coffee!! Most cafes are not like this! Most diners however are.... 
Almond croissants ARE all that, but they are sooooooooooooooo sweet. Way sweeter than classic french patisserie style. Also, they are much more vanilla bean flavored than almond liqueur flavored.

Emily guided us through the whole tasting process on their outdoor patio, and we settled on a lemon cake with cream cheese frosting. Since we were doing a full dessert bar, we decided to go with a smaller wedding cake, so we did the two tier, which ended up looking wonderful among the other desserts. Not only was the process enjoyable, but the pricing was more than fair, and best of all, the cake tasted AMAZING. So fresh, great lemon flavor, but not overpowering.

Super cheesy I know, but also accurate! We stopped at Bree'osh on our way out of SB and it was fantastic! We were between a quick bite here and a sit down breakfast at Scarlet Begonia. Well I don't know how Scarlet Begonia would have been, but we are definitely happy with our choice! 

Bree'osh is a cute little cafe/bakery with a counter that you order at and a few seats indoors and out. We opted for a semi-shaded outdoor spot and waited for our food and coffees.

Within just a few minutes we were brought a hot quiche Loraine, egg and bacon sandwich, and an almond chocolate croissant to share as well as two americanos. Bill came out to about $40

The quiche was fantastic. I'd venture to say best I've ever had. Super light, fluffy, fresh eggs inside and a light, buttery, flaky crust. The meat inside added the perfect amount of salt. My husband enjoyed his sandwich as well, but when I let him try my quiche he said he almost wish he would have gotten that too. We decided to save the chocolate croissant for a mid road trip snack, so I still have that to look forward to.

Overall excellent experience and a way to leave SB on a high note. Too bad we love too far to make another visit! Highly recommend if you're in SB!!",2019-09-09 18:19:16

If the restaurant was busy, tables full, line out the door, of course I don't imagine or expect that the cashier would take their time to smile and ask how I am doing, but when it's fairly mellow, it's hard for me to understand, as someone who has worked plenty of customer service, why friendliness and welcoming isn't a standard.

The salmon was good (a standard preparation, but they did it pretty well), but the duck was ridiculously overcooked (like duck jerky), and the sweet-and-sour cabbage tasted like it had been cooked with candy syrup -- ridiculous.  However, we add points back on because after we complained about the duck, they gave us a free chocolate roll.

The cupcakes are the best I've ever had. I am not exaggerating. My brother in law, his wife and my husband always share a dozen cupcakes during my visits. In addition, I get at least 4 or more cupcakes to bring home, and the drive is 6 or more hours! 

I am on a Nor-Cal cupcake mission, to find cupcakes just as good, so that I don't have to travel so far. I have tried 15 different cupcakeries, just to be disappointed! Crushcakes is STILL THE BEST. I feel sorry for some people in my area because they actually believe that the cupcakes from Kara's and Sprinkles and other smaller businesses are good. They just haven't tried Crushcakes! Their cupcakes never fail me, they are ALWAYS moist, the consistency of the frosting is just the right amount of thickness, and the flavors are to die for. The presentation is simple and eye catching at the same time, and the staff are always so friendly and helpful. When my brother in law comes to visit me, I always try to have him bring back cupcakes, because the cupcakes in my area are terrible. Last year, for my baby shower, Crushcakes specially decorated them to have a ""jungle theme' to match my baby's room! 

What's my favorite flavors? I love the buttermilk crumb cake, lemon drop, crushcake (red velvet), coconut cloud, cookies n' cream, cool vanilla bean and the daily specials of strawberry lemonade, and lime margarita!

Simply Divine! :)

This place is on a one way street... which is odd...and requires circling this place like a hawk... but it's worth it. I promise you!

We were lucky enough to find parking right in front... which was great... since Santa Barbara is way too congested! 

I loved the outside of the building to begin with... old architecture... adorable!

The inside was quaint. A little display case with some cute cupcakes in the case. I didn't see the added ""cuteness"" people were talking about in the other reviews... so I don't know.

I am SO glad that Pumpkie brought this place up!! So so glad! Plus, I got a cute added laugh at his comment about me looking at cupcake pictures as if I were looking at a cute puppy. Adorable.

The goods:

I had the Strawberry Cupcake...and it was heavenly! Probably the best strawberry cupcake that I've ever tasted. The ""strawberry cake"" part was moist and tasty... but not too sweet. The buttercream frosting on top was like an amazingly tasty strawberry ice cream... I really don't know how they infused the flavor of real strawberries in this light icing... but they definitely succeeded. It really was amazingly tasty and there was the perfect frosting to cake ratio. Yum!

We also shared a vanilla iced with chocolate cake. It was yummy. Vanilla-y and the cake bottom was moist and definitely very chocolatey. It was delicious too!

Pumpkie had a peanut butter chocolate one which he said was good...and now I can't remember the other one he had... oh no!

Oh yeah! The tie-dye cupcake. It was vanilla but the frosting was ""tie-dyed"" with different swirls. There was a chocolate disc ""peace sign"" on top of a yellow cake with sprinkles baked into it. He said it was good. I don't know. Didn't taste it... but it looked really awesome! :)

The cupcakes were amazingly tasty! Definitely check this place out if you're in the area... they're definitely one of the better cupcake places out there!",2012-05-22 06:09:10

My wife and I came here on the last morning of our weekend trip to SB. It was busy, but we were able to find a seat right away outside, which was a happy surprise because I had heard the wait can be a little out of hand at times. I ordered the eggs benedict which we both really enjoyed. As a few others had mentioned, while regular english muffins are available upon request, Andersen's serves it on a puff pastry, which was similar to a thinner croissant. I liked this because the breading wasn't all mush by the final few bites. The crispy exterior of the bread allow not get all soggy halfway through eating the dish. My wife ordered the eggs and homemade sausage. The eggs were eggs, but the sausage was really great and you could tell it wasn't just an average breakfast sausage. We were also given a free plate of a few different baked goods when we sat down and each was very well made. Very enjoyable food, as I said, 5/5.

The service gets a 3/5, but the servers were not rude, in fact they were very polite and welcoming. The problem was that there were at least 3, possibly 4, servers working the outside area, and while I have no problem speaking with multiple servers, it seems like the communication between their team was not as good as it could have been. To be clear, we didn't just call out to people when they walked by...each of these servers approached our table and asked if we had drinks or had given our food order, or needed anything else. We had to ask for water 4 times, and about 2 minutes after it came out (after our food had arrived) a 2nd server came out with 2 more glasses of water (we told the 2nd server we had already ordered water, but it hadn't come out yet). My wife asked for a cup of coffee when our food arrived, and then we had to flag down one of the servers (not kidding) 6 different times before the coffee was brought to our table. This was brought to us along with the side order of sourdough toast, which at that point our meals were finished and we had completely forgotten we had ordered. They said they would take the toast off the check as we were basically done and just finishing up our drinks at that point. A different server brought out our check and the toast was still on the check. We alerted our 2nd server who happened to be passing by this time and she took the check and our card, apologized and corrected the error. Like I said, each server was very polite and our food came out quickly and correct (minus the toast), it just seems like they may have a few communication issues due to a bunch of people all working the same area.",2016-01-25 22:09:46

While looking for State & Fig, the smell of Andersen's definitely caught our attention. It looked busy and the food smelled and looked amazing. However, we had plans to meet another couple who had a pup with them. I saw pets on the patio of Andersen's and wondered why they hadn't picked that spot. 

*I am posting about State & Fig separately. We didn't eat there...and although I hate leaving those kinds of reviews, I'm glad we didn't. Bad vibes!

I called Andersen's about the wait and the girl who answered the phone was so polite. Said the wait was 10-15 mins. It was around the corner. After State & Fig was a bust, we waited out front for the other couple to arrive. A table of 4 was getting up. We went up to the waitress letting her know the couple was at the light and pointed them out. She smiled and said it was perfect timing. And then said it was even better luck once she saw their pup. 

The waiter that came after her was super polite and liked to make small jokes. The food and coffee was amazing. He even brought us some complimentary banana bread and butter. They even had a dog menu and brought a treat for the pup. So thoughtful. 

All in all...we will all be coming back! Worth the food coma.",2018-08-14 21:03:20

The morning bun is flaky, buttery, sugary (but not too much), and the ideal breakfast pastry.  A close runner up is the cinnamon roll because it is also flaky, buttery, and yummy!  

Due to the pandemic they only allow one customer in at a time. They are very careful and it is greatly appreciated.  The sweet lady that helped us was so patient and gave such good explanations of the different pastries.

Their danishes are really good, and their chocolate cake is ridiculous.  They offered a sample of their almond butter danish, and I was tempted to get that, as well.
This is real dessert, people.  I've seen comments from some people about liking Costco danishes more than these authentic ones and, well...that's just wrong.  These danishes have the crispy, fluffy layers of real buttery dough, with real raspberry/apricot/cream cheese filling.  I can eat a Costco danish like the best of 'em, but those are slimy mass-production messes compared to these real ones.  These are also 4 times the price, so you get what you pay for :)
The chocolate cake was real chocolate, too.  I mean cocao, not hydrogenated oil with chocolate flavoring.  Very rich, moist cake -- and there was some alcohol-infused simple syrup added, likely to keep it moist longer.  Whatever the reason for it, it only added to the taste.
Simply nothing bad to say about this place.  And when I walked in with my jeans and T-shirt and talkative 2.5 year old in a stroller, I was treated just as courteously as everyone else.

It's definitely difficult to justify buying $3 cupcakes but if you IGNORE that part, you get a decently sized, very fluffy, flavorful, moist, frosting caked cupcake!  Looking at past reviews it looks as though the price of cupcakes hasn't changed since 2008 so I guess in terms of inflation, you are getting a good value?  I still think it's on the pricey side.

We ordered 8 cupcakes... 2 to try and 6 to bring home for the family.  We tried the red velvet and the strawberry and both brought the salivary glands to their maximum usage.  every bite made me say MMMMMMMMMMMMMM and while I'm sure there they are not healthy, i didn't feel weighed down by the density of the cake or frosting.  we shared one in the afternoon and then another one in the evening.  these particular cupcakes are not the type were you could eat multiple in one seating or else I'm pretty sure you'd get a sugar headache real quick.

We did have to scrape off some of the frosting, but really, when you're eating a cupcake the frosting is a necessary addition and decoration to the overall purchase.  you take that way and there is absolutely no way that i would consider buying a $3 cupcake.

seems like a hit or miss depending on your preferences in cupcakes, but i foresee myself coming back for another bite.",2012-04-27 20:15:57

She was reading off all of these delicious smoothies, which made it really hard to pick. And I was pleasantly surprised to find out that everything was green conscious, and many items were vegan and/or gluten free. 

I do have to say that it is a little pricey for the portion sizes. However, when thinking about how fresh and organic  and nutritious all the items are, it makes sense and is so worth it. 

The axxess deal gave you buy one get one free smoothie. I had the SB Greens and my friend had the Morning Superstar. It was great to see that the smoothies came with paper straws which just adds to their green conscious brand. 

I'm excited to come here to try some of the vegan foods and desserts with my mom as she is Vegan. I sent her a picture of the menus and she is already naming off a bunch of good ones. I know that we are going to have a giant spread, end up splitting it all, and have leftovers to take home...which you can't complain about that right??",2019-08-20 00:12:39

Even though red velvet doesn't come in the regular tasting, she let us sample red velvet cupcakes since that is what we had ordered for our cake.  Everything we tried was delicious so we decided to get half red velvet with cream cheese frosting and half white with raspberry Bavarian cream filling, plus a dozen red velvet gluten free cupcakes with chocolate frosting.

Only the best would do, and Renaud did not disappoint. We worked with Nicole, his wife, who was great to work with.  Renaud created a heart shaped raspberry and vanilla bean cake.  It was the most delicious thing -- I think I heard the gods sing!

I used my finger to spread the frosting evenly on my lemon cupcake. Instead of being bothered by the fact that the cake isn't very sweet, I actually really enjoyed the freshness and eggy taste of the cake today, which allowed the lemon frosting to shine in it's own way.

First of all, this place is super cute. The walls are all pink with this white iron furniture and the whole place is just crazy cute.

We sat down and were quickly brought a plate with some bread and pastry. Holy cow that pastry was the best thing I've eaten in a very long time. Apparently it's called ""Kringle"" and judging by the way this thing tasted I think it may have been a gift from Kris Kringle himself. It had super tasty marzipan inside a sweet flakey crust with some slivered almonds up top and I can't stop thinking about it!

Nothing on the menu looks very healthy, although they have omlettes and I'm sure you could make adjustments if you had the will power to stay healthy while eating here. For lunch I had the Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich. The chicken was lightly breaded, sautéed in butter and had some lettuce and pickled something. Normally this isn't the type of sammie I would go for but I'm so glad I did. Yes, butter was dripping down onto by plate but it was worth every future mile I will be committing to the treadmill.

We were too full to have any dessert, but we decided we would definitely be back later on in the afternoon to indulge again. We came back in the afternoon during their Happy Hour, although we did not have their Happy Hour ($6 wine with free Crustini). Instead we chose to share the encrusted Brie appetizer and a piece of some type of Marzipan Cake. The Encrusted Brie was super tasty, although a little small. The cake was seriously delicious. At $9.95 it was a little pricey, but since I'm not up in the area much I would definitely indulge again.

On my way out I was trying to figure out what to bring the hubs when they gave me a sample of the Butter Ring. Holy crap that was good! I think this may have been the ring Johnny Cash really fell into, cause man was this sinfully good. Luckily they taped the box well so I wasn't tempted to have more little samples of his treat on the way home.

Lastly, the service here is surprisingly fantastic. It's easy for popular places like this to just stop caring, but everyone here really makes you feel taken care of. Even people who were not our server stopped by to see how everything was, take away dishes, offer more water, etc. I love that and I will definitely come back here when I am ready to cheat on my newly started diet.

We chose a table outside since it was a nice day. It was a little crowded when a table of four sat next to us but we were fine. If you have a big group I might suggest indoors.

First they bring you a basket of pastries. Awesome! There was a piece of kringle, a scone and some bread. So fun to sample everything. The almond kringle was really tasty. For our breakfasts I ordered eggs and bacon and my mom got an egg white scramble.

The portions were quite large. Neither of us finished. My eggs came with potatoes and bacon apples. Yes that's right - bacon apples. Think cinnamon baked apples with bits of bacon. So good. There was also a piece of cheese and pate which I was not expecting. I had never had pate before so I was hesitant but it actually really good. It tasted like meatloaf mush. It was good on the bread that was in our basket.

The service was fine. I see some people on here complaining about it. Maybe we just got lucky but we had no problems with the service at all.

I would highly recommend Andersen's for breakfast or for their pastries. Yum.",2012-02-09 22:55:07

if you're like me and always crave ideally guilt-free junk food or just have too many dietary restrictions, green table in downtown sb is THE place to go to!! lots of the menu items are vegan/gluten free and pretty tasty-i got the vegan and gluten free mac n cheese, and my friend ordered a cauli pizza. the mac n cheese is made with a nut-based cheese, so it tastes a bit different, but personally, i loved it because i'm allergic to the ingredients in normal mac n cheese and really craved some comfort food.

the store is a bit hidden (it's near breakfast culture club;)) but aesthetic-wise, the food and store interior are a solid 10/10!! however, green table is a bit steep for pricing, and the portions aren't too big :( minus that, i would definitely recommend coming to green table occasionally to treat yourself to healthy noms and desserts!!",2020-01-29 22:13:23

Renaud's has been a favorite precisely because they always allowed simple substitutions without penalizing patrons with extra charges.  Adding the restrictions, as well as removing two of our favorite lunchtime dishes, will result in our dining there less often.

The person who took my order was a bit snarky, but it was hot that day, so I'll forgive him.  We ordered their tri tip sandwich, yogurt, and the almond croissant.  Their tri tip sandwich is one of the better ones that I've had in Santa Barbara.  The yogurt was good - not too sweet.  The almond croissant was very, very good.  The only thing I didn't like about Renaud's was their serving size.  After I finished the sandwich, I sat there wishing for more.  
Also, don't order their drinks. They are overpriced.  I think I paid $3/4 for a glass of like, Lipton iced tea or something like that.  Their house mint something something tea is also not worth the dollar amount they put on the board.",2015-09-03 06:15:39

I had the pleasure of having the Parm (eggless quiche) which had a lot of hearty greens, tomatoes, and a nutritional yeast crust. Interestingly, it was shaped like a snowball or scone. Nonetheless, amazing flavors! I've also had the Mac & Cheese which was unforgettable... Not too sure of the ingredients or whether it's vegan but oh WOW, so good! Has hints of mushroom and is well worth the try.
All of these dishes are vegetarian and are so flavorful! They're all reasonable priced and good portions. I definitely recommend visiting this place and ordering a matcha tea or green pressed juice :)

We ordered the Egg and Cheese Brioche Sandwich, which was excellent. The bun was unbelievable soft, buttery, and tasty. The eggs were scrambled very well. They were soft without being too wet/gooey, and held their shape which was amazing - they didn't fall out of the sandwich at all, so we could cut it in half and take clean bites without losing anything. The sandwich also comes with a creamy and cheesy chive spread which complemented the sandwich nicely. 

The Vanilla Latte was also tasty and well-balanced. It was creamy, not too sweet, and tasted enough of coffee. 

The cocoa croissant loaf looked and smelled amazing. We didn't end up eating it until the day after we bought it (our bad!) but even on day 2 it was flaky, buttery, and soft.

Now there are two places in town with perfect French croissants (the other is D'Angelo's down on Gutierrez), but there is only one with the full range of patisserie temptations, and that is Renaud's.

Tucked away in a strip mall, Renaud's would be easy to overlook, or indeed, not find at all. Forget the outside however, and walk inside to find a small Paris bakery, with a few small tables for a quick snack or lunch.

The display case is stunning. Or rather, its contents are stunning. I defy anyone to view the fineries on display and not crack a smile.

I have yet to try anything there that hasn't been every bit as sublime as it looks. However, I am not convinced that every single creation is as perfect as it seems. And therefore, I think a lot more 'testing' is called for over at Renaud's. I can't wait!",2008-11-10 03:10:25

My fiancé came to Santa Barbara for a tasting of their three most popular cakes: lemon with buttercream, chocolate with chocolate buttercream and white cake with raspberry filling and buttercream (the last one I'm not 100% sure of). All were amazing! Full slices of cake and little bottles of water made for a delightful tasting experience. They have tons of different cake, frosting and filling combinations on their site as well.

I WAS WRONG. 

Service & atmosphere: so the space is really cute inside, but sitting outside was perfect for a Sunday morning brunch. The service was fast and very friendly. This would definitely be a good spot to bring parents and assume they'll pay (especially since the brunch is a few more dollars above average).

Food: first of all- FREE PASTRIES JUST FOR SITTING DOWN. I forget the name, but two slices each of cinnamon and pumpkin pastries. They were so flaky and not overly sweet. For my main brunch entree I had the crab cake benedict. The crab cakes were so flavorful and let me just say that instead of an English muffin, there was puff pastry- MacArthur genius award level brilliance right there. I also may have eaten everyone else's since I have no self-control and no sense of shame. The waffle witch was huge and had great flavor combos, especially if you love their citrus infused waffle. The Charlotte omelette was also really tasty, loved the brie and bacon together!

The Vegan banana bread was absolutely amazing! It's made out of coconut flour, chia seeds, bananas, strawberry's. I'm not vegan but this bread is making me consider a switch. 
I've had the Mac and cheese for food, they also have a vegan option! It's on the heavier side but really delicious and flavorful. Just watch out for the chunks of garlic. I'd still very much recommend.
The Green Table burger is great, but note that it is cold not warm! It's pretty much an arugula salad tossed with goat cheese and shreds of purple cabbage sandwiched between a cauliflower bun and a very thin veggie patty.

It was the most magical of days, made sweeter by our impressive and tasty dessert selections. Leah was such a gem to work with, wonderfully gracious and accommodating to all of our requests.

After trying their cupcakes at a birthday event, I immediately wanted more. I love desserts, but if it's overly sweet then it's not for me. By far these cupcakes are the best that I've ever had! I've pretty much tried every flavor they offer and they are all equally delicious. The ingredients are top quality, and the amount of sweetness is just right. They are light, airy and melt in your mouth. I love that they offer the cupcakes in mini form or whole, so if you want to try all of them, then the mini cupcakes are perfect for sampling. They make these daily, so you don't need to order them unless you want a specific flavor or amount for a special event. 

After eating the cupcakes, I knew that I would order my son's birthday cake from this bakery. I placed my order online, which was very simple to do, but the hard part was choosing the flavor of cake, filling, and icing. Mind you, my son likes any cake so I knew whatever cake I ordered he would be happy with. I decided to order the 6-inch mocha cake with Bavarian cream filling, fresh strawberries and whipped cream icing. I was able to customize the cake online by choosing a decoration, color, and wording. Due to COVID times, and not being able to have large gatherings we had a safe celebration at home. Hence the reason for keeping the cake décor simple.  

The cake was perfect in every way! The whipped cream icing was not too sweet, the mocha cake was moist and flavorful, and the filling was creamy and light. This is the type of cake you could eat without your teeth hurting from the sugary sweetness of a typical store-bought cake. 

I will definitely be ordering from here again, and now that I've written this review I am craving their cupcakes ha ha.",2021-04-13 17:07:12

There is a lot of free parking in front and across from the bakery. They have tables outdoors in this cute patio arrangement. A short walk away is Butterfly Beach, the perfect place to enjoy your breakfast if you don't want to stick around the bakery.

The apple strudel was pretty decent, but not comparable to what I had in Vienna. The complimentary pastries had decent flavor, but I wish they were softer. They didn't seem freshly baked.

Food 3.5/5
Not as creative as brunch places in San Diego or LA, but I think this seems to be a more traditional European brunch place. I think there could've been more variety with the benedicts (maybe some veggie ones, a short rib one, a turkey or chicken one). 
I ordered the scottish salmon benedict, but it's normally not my first choice for a benedict. It was pretty good and the smoked salmon tasted average, but not significantly different than something you can buy from the grocery store. If I hadn't added the avocado for $1.95 I don't think I would've enjoyed this dish as much. 
Tried my friend's croissant french toast- I wasn't blown away, but it was still decent. I honestly could make this at home. I've seen more creative versions of french toast at other brunch places in So Cal. 
Potatoes- pretty good, standard

Price 2/5
Not surprised by the prices because I looked at the menu beforehand, but food in Santa Barbara is just more expensive for often lower quality in general compared to the bigger cities (San Diego and LA). My benedict was almost $17 and then another $2 for the avocado. In San Diego you can get this for about $13-15 at most brunch places.

Ambiance 5/5
Cute and quaint place. Lots of pink. Antique look. Look like a European bakery for sure.",2017-05-12 06:09:53

We are staying an 18 minute walk away at the Four Seasons and this is the place I wanted to try for brunch.  The walk is really nice after you cross the railroad tracks and the freeway overpass.  I really wanted to try the almond croissant it looked delicious.  I also had a brioche egg and bacon sandwich with salad.  Everything here is made to order and wonderful.  We were able to secure a seat inside and now I want to go back and try all the other pastries.  Highly recommend coming here when you are in Santa Barbara. Happy Yelping!,2019-09-28 17:42:55

Heard much about Lokum through Instagram and I told myself that the next time we were in town that I'd stop by to try their baklava. We paid $3 for a small serving of the traditional baklava (gently topped with ground pistachio). A little expensive but it's to be expected ... we're in Santa Barbara on the busiest street downtown. 

The flavor and texture that I'm used to with baklava has always been 'too sweet' and 'hard' which is probably because I've always purchased baklava in prepackaged portions like at Costco or at the grocery store. Lokum's version is fresh and unlike any that I've had before. It's authentically good! Not too sweet, chewy and very flavorful. 

The turkish coffee is served as a shot but it's so dark and rich. Any coffee connoisseur would appreciate the boldness of it's flavor and so concentrated that it will definitely wake you up!

You can pick how much of each flavor you want, and they will slice off that much and put it in a bag, a bit a la See's Candy.  Our favorites were the rose, pistachio nougat, and chocolate, although the one with mastic was really unique and tasty as well.

FYI State Street is currently closed to cars and has been turned into one long piazza full of patio dining, booth vendors, and live musicians.  Parking on a nearby street wasn't too hard to find, although a few birds did leave some very large, wet presents on the car for us (seriously, at 8 pm?  go to sleep already!). Luckily washed off with a bit of water.  Overall a great experience.",2021-03-05 16:41:09

There was plenty of seating to accommodate the busy brunch crowd but it really feels like a European cafe even with its location in the back of a strip mall.

The staff were overwhelmed, there were only two people working the register and prep area (not sure how many were working in the kitchen), one of the folx working the register seemed new and swore to me the pesto was nut-free only to check with a colleague and be corrected--and that's a dire mistake. Also, they forgot one of our orders. 

On the bright side, after realizing their mistake, they hustled to get the missing food out to us just 10 minutes later. They brought over two free vegan cookies as a 'sorry' to boot, which was much appreciated. The food that my amigxs got was totally solid, according to them. 

I have a cashew allergy, and the dishes were cashew-rich, so whereas normally I'd taste everyone's dish to verify, I just stuck to my own veggie pesto sando. In that I subbed sunflower almond spread for pesto to avoid cashews, at the suggestion of the more knowledgable cashier. My food was super duper, so judging from that and the satisfied smiles and empty boxes all around, it seems like the grub hit the spot.

Everybody recommended Renaud's famous almond croissant, so of course I had to try one of these. Price was a bit expensive, but how can you put a price on deliciousness right? Especially if you're trying it for the first time. Apparently you can ask the workers to heat it up for you so you can eat it warm, which I did not know! Even so, I still found the almond croissant to be everything I had hoped for. The top of the croissant was smothered in almonds. The texture of the croissant skin was crispy and flaky, while the inside of the croissant was soft and chewy. Amazing right? And I did not expect the almond crumbles inside of the croissant - that made it 100 times better! 

I wasn't planning to buy anything besides the almond croissant, but I was taken by the apple tart that was calling my name. There were two different flavors, but I ended up going for apple. And so glad I did! Probably the most amazing apple tart I've ever had in my life. It wasn't warm, but it was still super flaky - taste was amazing. Not too sweet, but once you hit the center of the tart, you get the ooey sweetness and goodness of the apple filling. I personally liked this better than the almond croissant, but my parents liked the almond more. 100% worth the money. 

We ended up buying a hazelnut or chocolate macaron. Price was less than $2 I believe. Nothing special about it. The texture was good - slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, but nothing too overwhelming. The chocolate taste was solid and strong. They didn't have flavors like salted caramel or whatnot, so I probably won't get macarons again if I ever return to Renaud's. 

Credit cards are accepted and they have about 3 locations in Santa Barbara - all within a few miles (or minutes) of one another. Parking was easy to find here. Pretty much grab and go. They also offer sandwiches and lunch items, but I'd stick to the pastries.

tl;dr - I love macarons, but I'm finding them harder and harder to satisfy when there are so many wonderful things in life like Renaud's almond croissant or apple tart. I definitely want to return and try their Exotic cake. They have a location in Long Beach, so maybe I'll make a stop there one day!

I got the avocado toast with egg sunny-side up. Normally it is served on ciabatta bread. It hasn't arrived from their bakery yet so they subbed sourdough. The avocado was served fork crushed under a bed of watermelon radish topped with a lovely sunny egg ready to run sprinkled with crushed pepper. A perfect way to start my day!

We also got the smoked salmon tartine. This toast is also normally served on ciabatta bread but was subbed with sourdough spread with a light cream cheese under the smoked salmon topped with cherry tomatoes and capers. Smoked salmon is always delicious if you're into it. Loved it!

The mushroom and cheese croissant looked and smelled delicious. Upon cutting into it, the beautiful waft of mushroom and cheese permeated my nose. Mmmm. I should have stolen a bite.

Look at the French toast. Isn't it beautiful! The crust on it is marvelous. I mean literally, I could marvel at its beauty. I love bread!

3. I have enjoyed my oat milk lattes. I did have to remind the barista not to use her bare hand to cover the entire top of the cup which she did in order to push the cardboard hand protector up it while she held it

I would recommend they set those aside so customers can put them on themselves. I also recommend that they only put the lids on lightly and tell the customers to put them on or to be careful and avoid the area where you put your mouth on it

When I gave her that feedback she immediately got a fresh cup, a glove for the non gloved  hand. 

 They are not the first ones to do this. Safety tip I keep an eye on the barista 's. I also always tip well I know it's harder for everyone.   And a safety reminder for the restaurants and cafés to be really mindful of these cross contamination points and to change their gloves often

Passing through Santa Barbara on the way up north, this location was a great breakfast spot for either to go or quick sit down meal. My partner ordered the brioche egg sandwich and I had the ham and cheese croissant + a must have, almond croissant! 

Food talk. the brioche bun was light fluffy and amazing and probably the best brioche I've had. But to me the star was the croissant. It's amazing to see the lavers that were achieved on the croissant which made it amazingly buttery and flaky and honestly the last time I had a croissant this amazing was when I lived in Montreal but this has definitely topped that. The almond croissant is one of the best I've ever had. The marzipan was perfectly sweeten with a balance almond flavor which is not always the case with most almond croissant which seemingly put waaaayyy too much almond extract. Definitely get the almond croissant ! 

Compliments to the chef . Worthy of the five star rating! Highly recommend and must have ! Can't wait to come back.",2020-11-26 18:46:50

This place has a bunch of Turkish sweet treats with really unique flavors, and the interior of the store is absolutely beautiful. Just seeing their displays was mesmerizing.

You pay based on weight of the items you get -- kinda expensive but it's 100% justified bc these desserts seem intricately made and seem to use high quality ingredients. They have both cubes of turkish delight and these delicious rolled turkish delights (flavors such as marshmallow/nutella, hazelnut, etc). I thought the flavors were hit or miss tbh, wasn't a fan of any marshmallow ones but thought the hazelnut was incredible.

I didn't try the baklava but my friends did and thought it was delicious. They also have a coffee/tea bar in the back that I didn't check out.

Floral, chewy and multi-textured without being overly sweet, the candy was wonderfully unique. I appreciate that the employees allow you to purchase candy in relatively small amounts, and I ended up purchasing about half a bar to share with friends. The pricing was reasonable, in my opinion. Everyone was thrilled with the taste.

To give that extra special touch, the candies are packaged in small boxes that explain the history of the confection, and you are provided with a little tote bag to carry your purchase.

Cookies & Cream - very fluffy and icing perfectly matches the cupcake. Highly recommend this flavor.

Cookies are guaranteed to be warm, even if they may not be fresh out of the oven.  They were sold out of double chocolate chunk, so I got the Super 6...5 classic chocolate chip cookies and one deluxe Triple Chocolate Chunk.

All in all, a good experience.  The cookies were warm, loaded full of chocolate chunks, ***BUT***  there is some sort of amaretto flavoring going on with the dough that makes the cookies slightly too perfume-y for my taste.  The almond perfume flavor isn't working for me.

Growing up, we would always get little boxes of pistachio Turkish delight from the local Greek grocer. This really took me back, and LOKUM had so many flavors to choose from! For 1 pound of treats, it's $29, but there is no minimum purchase, so we ordered a few pieces just to try. Each one was soft and flavorful. My favorites were the pomegranate + chocolate and rose. Lots of Mediterranean flavors here, like saffron, cardamom, rose, and pistachio, but they also carried fun alternatives like Oreo! We loved the Turkish coffee too. If you have never tried it, it is a very strong and flavorful brew that comes in a tiny cup, much like an espresso. We loved the cardamom and Ottoman coffees. 

They had a lovely outdoor seating area right on State Street and it was a perfect treat on a lovely afternoon. The interior was sparkling clean and beautifully decorated as well. A super nice touch was the ""Turkish hand sanitizer"" they gave us, which smelled like rose water. Ahhhh.

Love the creative concept and huge selection! Absolutely worth a visit!",2021-04-12 15:51:53

We tried several items off their menu. We all family-styled some of their menu items like:
- the hangover helper  -  sammy with everything that makes a wonderful breakfast
- red velvet pancakes - because I'm a red velvet fan
- bappled panini - brie, apple, turkey panini , one of my fave combinations

The prices reflect what I imagine their lease must be.  Our mushroom and Swiss croissants were $8.50 each and an almond and plain croissant for the road brought the total to $26.  Service is cordial considering how busy they were and they chop through their line quickly.  There is little room inside due to said line so you're better off finding a table outside.  There are about half a dozen seating two to four people.  Parking is street and I saw a parking structure nearby.

The sandwiches, of course, were very rich.  Butter croissant, lots of cheese and Bechamel to top it off.  Watch those calories fly!  Laminated dough is the central theme of this café so the real barometer of quality is the croissant itself.  They're a little denser than my favorite bakery in Gardena placing them as a solid but not the best.

My wife was very pleased with her coffee and chocolate croissant as well, and all the pastries on display looked delicious. 

A couple of things to note: the patio is very nice place to enjoy your coffee and pastry. I'm sure it fills up fast. We were still on East coast time so we got there shortly after they opened and there were several tables to choose from. Also, the service counter is right inside the door, so if you see a line out the door it doesn't necessarily mean the line ahead of you is long.",2021-09-22 22:03:08

I came here when I was visiting Santa Barbara and it was so good I actually had to drive back from LA to bring my friend here to go again. Not only is the coffee the best coffee that I've ever had anywhere, but the food is absolutely fantastic. I cannot stress enough how good the drinks are here considering I love coffee and I've gone to a lot of different places but this is by far the best. The cinnamon honey latte as well as the vanilla haze latte are so good and the the Angeleno is a delicious iced drink. I also tried their Break of the day burrito and their Soyrizo burrito and the flavors and serving sizes were impressive. But what I want to emphasize more than anything was the actual heart of the café. All of the people that work there are so friendly, amazing, will absolutely turn your day around and care so much about the work that they're doing. We were lucky enough to meet the owners son, Zach, who is one of the sweetest most passionate people I've ever met. You can tell that Zach cares about this place more than anything else and their heart and soul goes into everything done there. Not to mention Zach making a killer latte, our day was also made in the process. I would honestly drive back to Santa Barbara just to go here again. If you live anywhere near here or are stopping through I urge you to go here over anywhere else; your experience will be worth it in every way. Support a cafe that has an amazing family and people at its heart.",2020-11-04 19:45:57

Just the amazing pastry case should be enough to lure you in. But the charming ambiance, superb-quality food and incredibly friendly service are what really seal the deal here. 

The brunch menu makes it hard to choose what to get, but the waffle with strawberries is fantastic. The real show-stopper here though was the Benedict. I got the Florentine Benedict and - I kid you not - it was the best Benedict I've ever had in my life. It was a texture, flavor, comfort bonanza. They use puff pastry as the base layer instead of English muffins and oh my god I can't believe more people don't do this. 

The flaky crispness of the pastry combined with the perfectly poached eggs, creamy hollandaise and snappy asparagus - amazing. 

If you're a fan of eggs Benedict, this place is a must-try!

Charlotte, you are a genius and truly a gem for all the amazing food you and your team at Andersen's think up! I can honestly say it's so rare to find the quality, hospitality and pride that we encountered at Andersen's. You can tell that the staff truly care about the food they put out and the experience their customers had. They were so warm, friendly and the food certainly matched the quality there!

I'll be recommending Andersen's to everyone I know visiting SB and I know it'll be a favorite of mine whenever we come back to visit.

They are a bit smaller than the Sprinkles cupcakes, at $3 a pop. However, they are totally worth it. All their cupcakes are super moist (even 2 days later)! The cream cheese frosting is light and not too sweet when you eat it together with the cake. 

I tried the RED VELVET, which was great. However, I found it to be a little bit heavy on the chocolate taste and a bit too sweet. 

The BLACK AND WHITE was delicious. The cake is a swirl mix of chocolate and vanilla cake. The frosting is also a swirl mix as well, topped with black and white sprinkles. 

But my absolute favorite that I bought was the COOKIES AND CREAM. The cake was the swirl mix of chocolate and vanilla cake, same as the black and white. BUT the difference is the frosting, which was a cookies and cream frosting with chunks of oreo cookies in it. They even top it all off with a oreo cookie. DELICIOUS!

Super cute place. They have a cafe right next door. I saw quite a few tables order their red velvet pancake. Definitely need to go try the cafe next time I return!

Must search my phone for photos and add after but always delicious the best almond croissants I've ever had...

it's truly another pastry animal altogether. You've likely never fully lived until you've had one... even if it's soooooo not on your eating plan like mine (whoops, thx enzymes) it was worth the consequences! 

I do wish they had some gluten free and dairy free selections. 
I hope they will have them soon. 

Nice location with dog friendly patio tucked in then end corner of the parking lot in Loreto Plaza by Gelson's for years has been a go to for locals... 
A lot less dreamy in description without worthiness but I will aim to post some better photos for y'all who haven't been there! 

I went to high school just up the street so I've had my post office box there about 25 years! 
Love to fequent many other businesses in the Plaza like Federal drug and other awesome iconic spots like Chaucer's bookstore and some changing businesses over the years.
So this is absolutely somewhere I am near often!!!  

The food is well loved and the service is definitely adequate or better in my experience lately. 
Depends on the day the person etc. 

Renauds is a slice of French pastry heaven in a foodie town...Tarts, croissants, macarons etc. all gorgeous!
One of our well loved places that anyone visiting or living here should frequent for a bite even if you just grab a single macaron it's worth it. Tarts etc. gorgeous single or quadrupled in a box. Delightful.o
Great as gifts for others if it's not on their food plan also...and if it's they will beyond thank you for it. ;)

I love cupcakes and any place that devoted to solely making cupcakes is ok by me! I couldn't wait to go here. I even skipped the walk to the pier so I could have time to make it to this place. 

We walked until we found this little unsuspecting corner on Anacapa St. and low and behold, there it was! It was boiling hot in there but I didn't care. I surveyed the flavors and decided on strawberry blush
(sweet strawberry cake topped with rosy pink frosting) and crushcake
(our signature red velvet cake topped with a chocolate heart dipped into sour cream frosting). My husband got a crushcake and chocolate bliss (scrumptious chocolate cake topped with creamy vanilla frosting). We had to take one extra for the road! They looked so cute with the swirly blob of icing on top and the little embellishments to dress it up. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into that delightful cupcake, but since I was driving I waited. 

We finally made it back home and I ate the red velvet first. I liked the flavor and the frosting was really yummy. The consistency was more like a muffin. It wasn't as moist as I like cupcakes to be but it tasted really good. The next day I ate the strawberry one. I had the same experience as the first. It was tasty but it was like I was eating a muffin, not a cupcake. I'm not mad though. This place was so cute and they weren't bad cupcakes, just not my favorite ones. The box was cute too.

We went at around 10AM on the Sunday of a weekend that saw Santa Barbara pretty empty, but it was doing good business even then. I'm not particularly into bakery food, and I almost tagged along without getting anything. But curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up having a stellar brioche breakfast.

It was a cute place, despite the awful name, small and cozy with a casually expensive Montecito vibe. There was a French couple running the show, and they were nice and kept things moving. We got a table on the little sidewalk patio (we had our dog with us, but I think the seating is mostly outside anyway), and that was pleasant.

The menu consisted of a variety of brioches and brioche sandwiches, with options for brioche-free salads (though obviously, this place was not designed with carb-free eaters in mind). My husband and father-in-law both got brioches--plain, raisin, and almond--while I opted for a sandwich. The brioche was truly exceptional, easily good enough to stand as the tentpole of an entire business. It was fluffy, light, and buttery, and it seemed to come more or less fresh baked. The almond brioche was a great pastry, studded with slivered almonds and spread with a sweet almond paste. I still preferred my brioche savory--I got a sandwich with artichoke heart, sundried tomato, goat cheese, and black olive on sundried tomato thyme brioche. It was delicious, packed full of flavor and delicate textures. Every element brought something to the table, and even though there was a lot going on, the brioche shone through and bound it all together. The sandwich came with a little side salad of wild arugula and parmesan, lightly dressed. It was the kind of salad I tend to ignore, but I ate every last leaf. This place just doesn't mess around.

I tend to skip breakfast most days, even when my husband goes out to grab a croissant or a scone. If Bree'osh were our corner bakery, I might change my habits. I'll definitely remember that brioche sandwich the next time we're in Montecito.",2015-12-19 22:59:05

Before Nancy Silverton brought real bread to Los Angeles, in the late 1970's I visited another bread and pastry shop in Santa Barbara operated by a lady named Dina Schley, who had also apprenticed in France.

Instead of the traditional English muffin (which is an option as a substitute, but why would you?) they serve a puff pastry which is nicely flaky and works well with the yolk and hollandaise. The crab cake was flavorful and had plenty of crab. There was a nice topping of hollandaise which added the perfect mix of creaminess with a touch of citrus tang. 
Most of their seating is outdoors so you can enjoy your breakfast in the beautiful Santa Barbara weather. 
Oh and I almost forgot that you should definitely add some of their rich coffee and a mimosa for the perfect breakfast balance.",2017-08-05 04:07:34

Chooket was owned by a delightful (yes, it is me saying someone is/was delightful) couple Matthieu and his wife who genuinely made you feel right at home when you entered their little shop on the Mesa.
Now we have different owners but owners who used to work as bakers, decorators in Chooket.
In order to judge the management change and because i liked the Chooket way of putting together a cake, i ordered my family Easter cake from Little Things.
I ordered a Yellow Cake with Dulce de Leche filling with Chocolate buttercream frosting. I asked for a simple decoration of Chooket's/Little Things ""dots"": no flowers or any flim flam. 
One of my pet peeves about a couple of the Chooket cakes that i have purchased is that the cake itself has often been over baked and therefore slightly dry. So i was on the lookout for that.
Happy to report that the Yellow Cake is moist, crumbly, custardy derived from using whole eggs as well as extra yolks giving the final product all of these attributes by way of the fat in the yolks and perhaps oil as well as shortening. In any event we were very happy with this cake: even the kiddoes who will eat anything with chocolate of course.
The Dulce de Leche custard filling did not make much of an impression but obviously it contributed to the general good feelings we all had after eating a slice.
Also: come to Little Things for their other goodies: lemon bars, sock-it-to-me Brownies, Cupcakes.
I approached Little Things with a little trepidation: would these new operators carry on what was good about Chooket? As far as i can surmise from this one cake: yes they have,",2019-04-27 16:22:42

Insomniac is in the middle of the very busy State Street, where the restaurants around this cookie shop are flooded with people, especially on a Friday night.

You can choose 2 different cookies for the cookiewich -- I paired cookies 'n cream icecream with a white chocolate macadamia and a m&m cookie. The icecream helps cut the sweetness of the cookie, and actually fills you up. I did find the chocolate in the m&m cookie to be a tad bit too sweet, and the icecream selection was also pretty small.

Locally sourced and freshly made, really their options fit just about anyone's preferences. 

When they first opened, Green Table was known for their almond milk matcha specials. I'm allergic to almonds so I cannot review these, but I do believe, as of Fall 2019, they carry coconut milk as a substitute. A favorite amongst my friends is the Salted Mocha Ice Blended Matcha. My drink of choice here is the Skinny G which has spinach, kale, parsley, celery, cucumber and lemon. You can add shots and/or protein to your juices, as well. Their drinks are definitely on the pricier side but pretty standard for fresh Organic juices in Santa Barbara, between $7-11.

Food wise, I try to get something different every time but our family favorite has always been the lasagne made with mushrooms, eggplant, spinach and house made pesto in combination with marinara sauce.

It was such a great flavor combo and I'd love to learn to make this myself.

These treats are a little expensive, but I was told that everything is imported from Turkey with Turkish ingredients which probably accounts for the higher price tag.  But enjoyed everything so much, it was worth is to me.

I bought three pieces of baklava to take home and share with my husband. My goodies were boxed up in a lovely  black box and placed in a very nice reusable tote bag! Very classy!

FOOD
Mushroom and Cheese Croissant - the croissant alone is so good. The added mushrooms and cheese make it even more amazing. 

Smoked salmon and avocado sandwich on brioche - the bun looks a lot heavier than it actually is. It's uniquely light and the sandwich is tasty. A light side salad is also included. 

Omelette with ham, gruyere, mushrooms - the eggs are light and fluffy... uniquely fluffy. The omelette would've been better if the ham were chopped up and if I had chosen a better cheese. I love gruyere, but maybe not in an omelette. 

FAVORITES
Mushroom and cheese croissant
Croissant
Cinnamon Roll
Eggs - I'd probably opt to add eggs to sandwiches vs getting an omelette.

I was looking for a place that has good pastries and saw all of the amazing reviews this place has. 

I haven't had Turkish pastries in a long time.

The staff is super kind & allows you to try samples, I only tried one because I wanted to hydrate before eating sweets. 

I ended up purchasing a chocolate hazelnut & chocolate pistachio. 

The price seems very fair for the good quality of pastries you are getting. They charge by pound for two small pastries was $6.60. 

The aesthetics of this place are absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend coming here and giving this place a chance. 

The customer service and hygiene of this place is great as well.

It is location in a shopping center with several of other stores/restaurants & etc.",2021-05-29 22:39:14

While we were looking inside at the display case, the cashier kindly gave us a sample of one of their cakes, and we decided to share a slice of tiramisu. The bold flavors were spot on. Because the sponge cake was thoroughly soaked in coffee and rum (so much so that a thin pool would form after forking a bite), the cake was delightfully rich. I'm definitely glad I split one slice with another person otherwise it would have been too much for me alone. The texture of each part was different than I expected. Although saturated with coffee and rum, the grainier sponge was harder and would crumble in your mouth. It was not light and fluffy, but rather dense. As for the mascarpone cream, it was velvety and smooth but on the thicker, heavier side. 

However, the label for individual cake slices didn't indicate how much it cost. Only after you finish it will they give you the bill--and $10 for a slice?! Excellent flavors, but not the best I've had and not worth the surprising $10.",2017-09-11 05:27:15

My husband and I decided to go there for breakfast. When we arrived, There already was a long line with waiting patrons.
Of course, due to COVID-19, there is only outdoor seating or take out. The line did go fast. And the busyness of the place with local customers made me feel like this place is well liked by the locals.
We found ourselves a small table in the shade, and ordered an omelette to share, coffees, and two croissants.
While we were still waiting in the line, the lady obviously the owner came out to announce in the cutest French accent that they were all out of specialty croissants and that they had only a few regular plain croissants left.
Our food came quick, was hot, and absolutely delicious.
The nice thing about the omelette was that you could choose three toppings out of seven different options. And the options given were really interesting, goat cheese, spinach, artichokes, grape tomatoes.
They were not joking when they said that everything here is locally grown. You could definitely taste that.The croissants were the biggest croissants I've ever seen, and no matter did they weren't specialty, just plain like that they were absolutely scrumptious. 
The only tiny critical comment I would have is that when they call your name they stay inside while you are seated outside and you can't really hear them well.

The croissant French toast is unique and tasty. I'd highly recommend even if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. It comes with whipped cream, raspberry syrup, and maple syrup on the side so sweetness level is for you to adjust! 
My mom ordered the traditional danish breakfast, with eggs, potatoes, ham, and pate. But it looked lacking in carbs..I'm not sure if I'd recommend it again. 
The chicken and waffles is also always a safe bet!

On the first time I came, brunch came with bread to start. Then the 2nd time we received complementary apple strudel! It would've been even better if warm, but the pastry was a great addition regardless. Their homemade orange marmalade is on every table and is great with any toast, croissant, or pastry.

I really felt like I was in west LA on a weekend morning, going to one of my local cafes. 

It's simple and the ordering is done in California cafe style (i.e. Urthh, Alcove, etc). You order at the register, take your # and place it on your table, and your food will find you. 

Just like most cafes, this cafe is small. But you have options. =)
You can sit inside or there is outdoor seating with umbrellas connected to the tables for shade. 

We ordered the egg sandwich, which comes with a side of fresh fruit, potatoes, or salad (I think?).  Peep the pix.

I chose the fresh fruit as a side because I saw figs were in it.  I love figs, and buy them regularly at the farmers market in the summer. These figs were a bit more chewy and not quite farmer market fresh.  Nonetheless, I appreciated the fig addition to the fruit medley. 

The egg sandwich - the bread was perfectly toasted.  It was a bit too salty for me because of the bacon. Overall, it was a little too oily for me. (Keep in mind for those who don't know me well, most things taste oily to me - just a personal food quirk.) Guys will enjoy this sandwich. 

I regret not ordering the European breakfast for $6.95, which consists of a cup of coffee, a piece of a baguette, and a croissant. 

French Toast - covered with condensed sugar.  This too was oily - much more than the egg sandwich. It's served with some fresh fruit preserves, which is not needed because it is already sweet. 


Coffee Station - you serve yourself.

Cappucinos and lattes will be made for you. 

They serve Orangina - pleasant surprise. 

For the record, it's really 3.6 stars. 

Location - in a strip mall, in the corner.

Thankfully, however, we have places like Lokum popping up like spring flowers! The folks that run this coffee shop and bakery also own Seven Hills Saratoga Turkish Imports & Bazaar (yelp.com/biz/seven-hills...) a few shops down State Street. You can't miss seeing Lokum since it stands out with extraordinary chandeliers and lamps, patterned tile floors, and canned Turkish coffee from floor to ceiling.

I met my fellow coworker and Santa Barbara Community Ambassador predecessor Dani N here for coffee and a chat. Lokum offers four various coffee flavors at $5 a cup including the original wood-fired, hazelnut, mastic (aromatic gum), and Ottoman (for a slightly higher price of $7). The coffee arrives at your table in a tiny cup with the option of sugar, a small cup of water and two cubed Turkish Delight samples. Of course, I had to choose an additional treat to enjoy with my coffee given their endless selection of Turkish Delights and Baklava. I went with the ""crunchy, juicy pistachio"" Baklava, as described by the employee. He did not steer me wrong! It was exactly just that.

I learned that Lokum is another word for Turkish Delight. If you're not familiar, it is ""a family of confections based on a gel of starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates, pistachios, and hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties are often flavored with rosewater, mastic, Bergamot orange, or lemon"" (thanks Wikipedia!). I'm huge on texture but did give it a try, however, I prefer the Baklava.

I ""cultured"" Dani a bit by having us flip over our cups and follow a specific process of reading one's Turkish coffee grounds fortune. We really had no idea what we were doing truthfully but whether there is a complete vs. incomplete circle, or any letters, symbols or numbers remaining inside the cup's coffee grounds tells us something.

While nothing inside this store is inexpensive, it is an exciting new place to check out in downtown Santa Barbara. It is said that they import fresh all the coffee and treats, so it's no surprise the prices a bit high.",2020-03-06 18:15:50

Bree'osh, a play on the word 'Brioche', makes Me and Montecito proud. They are a French-owned bakery who bakes delicious creations just as you would find on the streets of Paris. A chalkboard menu, a bold coffee blend (from Handlebar, of course) and staff with an oo-la-la accent. What more could you want?!

I tend to come here after hiking in the Montecito hills. It's one of the few places in Montecito where I don't feel judged when I'm in my outdoor wear. The interior is super small with counter seating at the front window and one table, while the majority of the seating is on the sidewalk patio.

Everything I have eaten here is perfection. From the fluffy egg sandwiches, rich croques, to the fresh avocado toast, everything is made just right. The secret is in their brioche dough which is light, yet buttery and decadent--hence their name. You can now skip the long lines that often go out the door on the weekends and purchase ahead of time online for pick-up at their Montecito or wholesale Carpinteria (near the Apiary and BrewLab) location.",2019-11-26 01:53:33

I'm not sure if they were the ones who set up the stand, but what I can say is that I enjoyed the signature red wrappers and the creative ways they decorate their cakes. From the classic indented swirl to the tie-dyed red-yellow-green frosting to the adorable chocolate heart they stuck on top of some red velvet (?) cupcakes, each one was visually appealing. My complaint with the frosting, however, would be that it's sugary sweet. Desserts are supposed to be a sweet chaser, but this tasted like way too much sugar.

They offer macaroons (yum). Lemon was tasty. I also have had a chocolate chip cookie and peanut butter cookie (super awesome). I've had a slice of the Bouche de noel (I think), which was sort of expensive for the size but delicious. Every part of it was perfect and beautiful. 

I've had a latte here. It was ok.

THE BREAKFAST SANDWICH IS AWESOME. I learned not to underestimate simplicity. When I received my breakfast sandwich, I thought, ""wow, that's it?"". But then I took a bite and I was blown away.

The basic bread slices were incredible on their own. The bacon was thick and quality meat. The egg was perfectly cooked. The mushrooms were great. Gosh it was good. So good. My side of fruit was super awesome. It had pears and pineapple (who serves that???)

The almond croissant is the most popular. My favorite though is the apricot, which is slightly less sweet with a plump fruit in the center of a square-shaped flakey pastry. This one in particular lends to a distinct crackling sound when you bite into it because the outer layers are crispy, while the inner layers are light though rich and buttery. And it's composed of dozens and dozens of these paper thin layers. It's a very attractive treat and engages the senses further with the scent of toasted butter. 

The entrees are pretty good, and especially the croque-madame if you like grilled cheese. It's a perennial French favorite with Béchamel sauce, Swiss cheese, ham, and a sunny side up egg on homemade sliced bread. 

For a no-brainer breakfast, get the ""Renaud's,"" which is a croissant of your choice with a seasonal fruit salad and cup of Numi tea or self-serve Peerless coffee. 

Available coffee flavors are organic French Press in decaf or regular, Kona blend, or Mexican.

Other foods here are mostly good, and few things are terrible, like the bran muffins. The salad is organic but clearly isn't a speciality, though it's a good side to cut the fat of a cheese sandwich or sausage.

The staff are very friendly and greet you instantly upon arrival. They know their products and their service like the back of their hands and can answer any questions on the spot. 

Amazed at the beauty of the artisanal Turkish delight rolls in the display cases, it took me a while to narrow down which one I wanted to try. All of them look so beautifully delicious but I had to go with the banana chocolate to accompany my ""bitter coffee."" To clarify, there are 3 Turkish coffee options: the coffee with mastic (which was the owner's personal favorite), the hazelnut blend, and the standard Turkish which is best for those who like it bitter and black, with natural flavor. It was delicious and paired well with the very sweet, banana dessert. Oh and make sure to Google Turkish coffee fortune telling, if you want the ultimate cultural experience - shoutout to the Yelp SB CA, Richie D, for brightening my horizons with this knowledge!  

Lokum does offer Wifi and outlets for those looking for a nice classy spot to plug in at. I wouldn't suggest coming on an empty stomach as they don't offer any meal options, but they make for the perfect dessert and coffee spot, post meal indulgence. I was a little sad at how tiny the Turkish coffee portions were, as I love the flavor of coffee and would have enjoyed sipping on it a lot longer. However, I understand and respect their unique, cultural ways of serving Turkish coffee. If you're curious about the difference, just ask, they'd love to give you the full low-down and would do a lot better job than I could. The coffee was served with two little Turkish delight squares and a cup of water. 

If you're looking for a unique gift for dinner parties, holidays, birthdays, etc, Lokum has a custom gift box option where you can mix and match baklavas and Turkish delights. I love how on the gift boxes they give a little history and background info about the desserts. The cost varies per item additions with baklavas being an average of $4-5 a piece. Though I cannot recall the exact pricing of everything, I believe the Turkish delight prices varied per size and roll, but I do know they're definitely not cheap. 

Not a coffee person? They offer hot tea, as well! There are a couple vegan options for those who have no preference against honey. Want to make Turkish coffee or tea at home? They have all the pots and kettles, teas and beans you could ever want, all available for purchase and all imported from Turkey. I highly recommend trying Lokum! Great for dates, dessert outings, Instagram posts, working remote, and just trying something new. I will definitely be back to try more turkish delight flavors next time I'm around.",2020-03-25 13:56:18

Food: I think I've had all their cakes at this point. All are superb. I would suggest the princess cake if you like marzipan, the strawberry shortcake if you like fruity, and their bailey's cake. But honestly, whatever you get is a win. 
During brunch they give apple strudel with your meal...and it's ohhh so good!

As someone who could appreciate some pastries but would absolutely be turned off by anything too sweet, the peeps at renaud balance this delicate balance and dance.

They were so delicious! The guy (I forgot his name) was really nice and generous enough to give us samples. Even though we were like ""oh, no thank you"" but still he insisted. He just wanted to make sure that we were choosing the right flavors to buy. Which we're very appreciative of! And we didnt regret the flavor that we picked!

The Croque Madame had a perfectly poached runny egg on the top of a thick brioche that had melted grilled cheese on the top. The ham and cheese on the inside was very good as well.

Employees seem to dress up to work here with some nice dress shirts and everything.
Something interesting about this place is how they give out free samples. Behind each item in the case you can see theres a piece of it sitting behind the rest already precut/set aside. At first I thought it was for whoever the next customer it is but I noticed they weren't the nicest looking cuts and realized they are to use for free samples to potential customers. So if you go in and you're browsing a bit, they'll definitely offer you to try a few items, especially if you point out one you're thinking of trying/buying. The two samples I got were both from cakes and not very good so I don't know if I'd come here for cakes in the future.

I do wish their items had prices under the signs they have displaying right next to them.

Princess Waffle was really tasty. It seemed like a giant lacey visually but instead of being filled with chocolate in the middle, it has some sort of butter cream that's similar to cream cheese but firmer. The texture of the rest of it wasn't as sticky as I was expecting, the oats/granola held up pretty well so it was still crunchy. Half dipped in chocolate and of course that was the better half!

If your not the outdoorsy type , then step right inside to a beautiful Danish backdrop of detailed dutch woodwork, as well as white iron tables & chairs, you will feel as if your in Solvang.  The bakery selection is to die for, I plan to come back another day and buy a few of these tasty morsels.

I chose to have the BTLA, while not a typical Danish meal it was nonetheless delicious , the wheat bread was toasted perfectly, bacon crisp, and tomato , lettuce & avocado were fresh, served with a side of steak fries you won't leave Anderson's hungry or dissatisfied. 

Service was top notch , we were always attended to and asked if we needed anything extra and the servers were open and friendly , and were more than accommodating when we forgot to have them split our check. 

All in all a very happy experience , thank you yelp reviewers for shedding light on yet a new favorite.",2015-10-25 03:04:57

We brought our dog Maggie and she enjoyed herself with many puppy friends around. I ordered the croque monsieur and my husband ordered the omelette with ham, bacon and spinach. 

Wow, just wow.

I took one bite of the croque monsieur and was taken back to the best croque monsieur I had eaten up to that point. I have to say... this one takes the cake. All future croque monsieurs will have to live up to the comparison of this crispy, cheesy, delightful bite. The brioche is perfect, the bechamel creamy and not overwhelming, and the cheese perfectly crispy. I highly recommend to stop by and to bring your pups too! You won't regret it!!",2021-04-17 15:44:31

It was my first time trying middle eastern anything and I was pleasantly surprised. The pastries are expensive for their sizes since they are considered a delicacy. I tried several turkish delights and my favorite was the rose petal covered pistachio and pomegranate one. This wasn't so sweet and it felt pretty healthy actually!

We loved it so much that we returned to have it again.  It comes with potatoes or fruit.  The first time I had the fruit with it and I will say that it was amazing fruit!

HENGTS210kDjo6PaRvN8rg,ZDMLDPkpc9ob9XIFOjRw1g,Ss6f5v_t5Vddiaz4ZOxL0g,4,6,6,4,"Two words: Apple Strudel.

They bake it fresh daily and you simply can't leave SB without one (or two) phallic parcels for the road.  When I lived off State Street, Andersen's strudel was a weekend breakfast staple.  Swing by in the morning if you want it super fresh (although it's pretty darn fresh anytime of the day).

Quick Tip:  If you show up right before closing, they'll usually mark the strudel down to two or even three for the price of one.  A major deal, albeit a bit rough on the waistline. But you'll be in apple/marzipan heaven for days.

Aside from the epic strudel, the other baked goods here are very high quality and certainly as beautiful as they are tasty.  Lots of butter and marzipan to be found here, but then you can never have too much of those ingredients in your desserts, IMHO.

I've only eaten here for breakfast a couple of times and the food was decent, but not amazing (by SB standards).  They offer high tea daily from 2pm to 5pm, and I read somewhere that they have live Jazz on Sundays from 3pm to 5pm.  They have seating both indoors and outside along State Street, so you can people watch while you nosh on your pastries.  The interior is very cozy and has a bit of a Laura Ashley / Avonlea feel to it;  You sort of expect to see Marilla, Matthew, or Anne stroll by your table any minute.

Quick note:  As my ever snarky friend Amanda observed, the servers here tend to be male and Abercrombie-esque;  Apparently, Mrs. Andersen is a bit of a Scandi-cougar who prefers them young and good looking.  She's either incredibly hot or just lures them in with those tempting pastries and homemade preserves.  I doubt I could resist such an offer if I were still in school.

Long and Short:  A decent restaurant with an impressive bakery and plenty of eye candy for the ladies.  Guys:  Leave your GF in the car while you pickup those pastries.",2013-04-08 23:54:34

Turkish delight is a great candy choice because it's not so sweet.  This can be good and bad because it meant I felt I could get away with eating more, and I wanted to eat more and more. 

There are several types of baklava available.  I tried the ""juicy pistachio"".  Soooo good.  Then I took three different types of Turkish delight with me.  I didn't care for the red pomegranate flavored one because it was too close to a bubble gum taste.  But I fell hard for the pistachio nougat.  I went back the next day and bought more to take to my sister's (well, let's be honest, and for me).

lemon kringle - a delicious, golden flaky puff pastry filled with marzipan and meyers lemon custard!!! this is definitely one of my favorites (they are actually all my favorite) but it is the perfect amount of sweet filling to puff pastry ratio, a perfectly balanced match!!

cinnamon crisps - i think these may have taken the cake!! they were incredibly crispy and each bite was perfectly cinnamony and extraordinarily delicious!!! this golden, sugary, flaky pastry is absolutely to die for!!!

i was insanely impressed by andersen's bakery selections, they left me thinking about that bakery all the rest of the week!! i will definitely have to come back and try out the restaurant, i bet their food is just as thoughtfully prepared and cared for as their pastries!!!

Shoppers walk around like they need to frenetically spend their 1000's of cash in their designer purses and wallets.   IF I'm going to set foot down here it better be good.

Thank goodness that Green Table has opened up, they are keeping me sane in DT SB.  Green Table is a very health conscious restaurant that doesn't just cater to vegans but they provide nourishing juices and food for an affordable price. 

First off the staff who work here are beyond nice.  Like 10 stars of niceness.  They help you with the menu, make suggestions, talk about transforming people's health in the area.  We need more people like this in our fragile world. 

First thing you need to do is check in and get your free dessert.  I could not help myself with just one and I have a zero sweet tooth.  I could not believe the choices here.  The Matcha balls are amazing.  They have a strawberry banana bread, delish.  Brownie is also rich and awesome.  You can't go wrong with any of the deserts.

Next is the food  and drinks they serve.  I tried the spicy lady juice with berry macha and a side of ginger shot because spicy is never spicy enough for my taste buds.  I don't think they charged me for the shot probably because that's how nice these people are.  It was super tasty.  I also got the raw wrap which had a dehydrated burger in a coconut tortilla with all kinds of fresh veggies.  When I saw the wrap I thought I would need to order two to get filled.  Wow how wrong I was with this little guy.  Each bite was so much more filling than any veggie giant burrito out there.  It is a cold dish so if you don't like raw foods then you might not like but I loved it.  They do have more normal dishes like a lasagna dish that has goat cheese that is made with almond noodles.  I heard it's very popular dish.  They told me that they try to vary the menu so it's more inclusive to people's different tastes.  Very cool idea IMO. Just make sure you ask because they do use cheese in some dishes that can't be modified. 

Thank you for making me sane in Santa Barbara.  See you next time.",2017-07-15 00:26:30

I've always enjoyed coming in as they open to get my hands on their freshly made macarons and cakes.

Starting in 2008, Co-founder and Executive Pastry Chef, Renaud Gonthier, has brought exceptional French flair to Santa Barbara's desire for (and previous lack of) a quality French pastry and croissant venue.

Although this Renaud's is right next to a bar where a lot of the shadier local riff raff type of people like to hang, a lot of them come out for a few smokes too which was a bit off putting (I feel like the location here in general is a bit sketchy, there are bums lurking near cars with open door windows and drunks that don't know when enough is enough as they go gallivanting across the streets.) The patio is just so picturesque with the striped parisian sunbrellas and beautiful iron dining sets, how could you not?

THE FOOD-

I ordered their Crooque Madame ($12.50) which was delightful, the eggs were creamy and bread at a certain crisp I dreadfully needed that wakening day. The croque madame also comes with a side salad which never disappoints. I love when salad is a bit on the softer side, especially when lathered in dressing - absolute perfection! The cafe latte that they serve here is one of the best in Santa Barbara, they make it stronger than most cafes in Santa Barbara.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This location is more for the older locals, parking is very easy to find. SB has a Renaud's on lower state street too, but far smaller, and doesn't quite have the charm as this one. I would recommend Renaud's to every local in Santa Barbara.",2018-01-18 18:30:42

When an early morning trip to Santa Barbara warranted breakfast, my search fortunately and finally turned me onto Bree'osh, Cafe Montecito.  

Our order was performed online, but it later turned in-person because of all the goods at the shop.  There are several street parking spots in front of the cafe on Coast Village Road.  Be greeted happily with the cheerful yellow paint and make sure to read the signs on the storefront for baguette availability, specials, and other notices.

The pastries are incredible, fantastic, and laudable.  The croissant has an impeccable crisp on the outside from the numerous layers, is delectably flaky, and then finishes with an interior that is a breath of tasty, buttery air.  We also procured savory and sweet: Almond, Chocolate, Ham and Cheese, and Mushroom and Cheese.  The mushroom and cheese croissant was a major standout with a perfect balance in flavor (still taste pastry!) and texture (creamy).

We could not resist ordering bread while picking up croissants and it turned into brioche and baguette (8 AM) add-ons to our order at the store.  The brioche has a cake-like interior consistency and I can attest that it is good days after (250F, baked a few minutes).  It's not overly butter-flavored and I appreciate that about the brioche.  The baguette, a bread I dislike personally, is not as crisp on the outside (plus for me) and the inside of the baguette is fluffy!  In comparison to a baguette from Republique, Bree'osh has the version that would make me consider eating a baguette again.

With regards to service, I have a lot to appreciate since I am neither a regular and experienced a delay to food.  Our hot food order took a long time, it is likely due to a miscommunication.  We waited patiently outside in view of the shop and with the amount of customers Bree'osh has in the morning, I chalked it up to that.  In the end, Nelly (?) and the staff apologized for the long wait -- only apology needed is keeping us away from how good this pastry is.  :)  Everybody made it right, thank you for making a trip and day.

Finally, if you don't want to eat at the cafe itself, you can take the pastries and head to Butterfly Beach nearby -- there is a walking tunnel, be careful.  The pastries do not need the view to elevate it, but it made for a marvelous morning.",2021-04-16 17:52:13

The service has been good to me as well as the food. I have yet to have a bad meal here. On my latest visit I tried the French toast croissant which was delicious and you get 4 croissants! I could only finish two so i had plenty left over for the next day. I ordered a side of bacon (2 pieces) but once served they were skimpy and for $3.95 I'd expected at least two thick slices. There was nothing special about it. I'll pass next time unless it comes with the meal. The blood orange mimosa is also my favorite when available. 

They have delicious and beautiful looking desserts to choose from if you're craving something sweet after your meal. The most popular choice and one of my faves is the strawberry fragelite. This dessert is creamy, light, fluffy and not overly sweet. The bee stings has little pieces of apple and is just as delicious. Order the coffee!

After we ordered our food, she came by and gave two pastries to snack on while we waited for our food - an apricot one and a lemon one. Both were delicious and complimentary.

For food I ordered the crab cakes eggs Benedict and the rest of my party got the honest waffle, chorizo burrito, and smoked Scottish salmon. The crab cakes eggs benedict was super filling but super delicious! The crab cakes are fried so there was an outer layer that was perfectly crispy and there was just enough hollandaise sauce where you could taste a little bit of everything. I got mine with avocado and that just really tied everything together. All of their eggs benedicts come on a croissant instead of an English muffin. It makes it harder to cut but the croissant is absolutely delicious. The eggs were also poached just right where you could pop them but the yolk doesn't get everywhere and make everything taste the same.

The honest waffle was really huge and looked very sweet. It was two Belgian waffles cut into fourths topped with strawberry compote and whipped cream. The whipped cream wasn't super sweet but I could see how this dish would get tiring to eat after the first few bites.

The chorizo burrito was also a generous size, definitely manageable if you are hungry/can eat a lot. It tasted very clean and not greasy at all. Also came with a side of salsa and sour cream.

The smoked Scottish salmon came with smoked salmon on top of toast, cheese, onions, and capers. The salmon tasted very clean and fresh and light.

I shopped around and came across The Little Things Bakery.  At first, Celia impressed me by responding so quickly to my inquiry on their website.  When I was ready to place my order over the phone, Leah stepped right in.   Leah offered some great ideas for the cake. I ended up going with a TMNT cupcake cake, which I had no idea could be done.  My grandson absolutely loved it.  It was the perfect size and from what I was told tasted ""yummy""!  

Both Leah and Celia were super helpful and hands down offered some of the best customer service I've experienced in some time. Not to mention, the cake was very tasty.

He followed them with his eyes and had to know that they were interested in eating hot food.

They came to the counter and started to order. He coldly responded that the kitchen is closed.

There is a sign on the window that says the restaurant is ""open."" Anyone would assume that it includes the kitchen. Especially since the hot food menu is still up.

It was a distasteful experience.

The Fried Egg Sandwich is a must try! I seriously dream about it. It's heaven in your mouth. 

Renaud's starts with thick, butter, toasty on the outside, moist on the inside, freshly baked brioche bread. Then they layer a delicious fried egg to perfection, thick, crispy bacon, sauteed mushrooms, a generous slice of beef steak tomato and melty gruyere cheese. All that is topped with another slice of their bread and there you have heaven...sandwiched. 

I recommend asking for a side of their homemade jam and slathering that on one side of your toast to create a flavor sensation for your taste buds that you'll crave for days and weeks to come!

I had the Green Table Burger with goat gouda cheese.  When I first arrived I asked the person at the counter for her recommendations. She had recommended a different burger, which I unfortunately forgot the name of. However, it did contain chili pepper so I opted to stick with my first choice of the Green Table Burger. The person at the front had suggested the other burger because it was warm and this Garden Table Burger is cold, more like a salad. That was exactly what I was looking for! I very much enjoyed it. The ingredients tasted very fresh. I appreciate the cauliflower-egg bread.

My partner got the burger with chili. He said it was very spicy... which he loved. He also had a pink milky drink. I snuck a sip. It was surprisingly not as sweet as I assumed it would be. I'm used to any sort of fruit protein shake being too overwhelmingly sweet. This one was quite perfect. 

For a special treat I bought an almond caramel power ball. I think $3 each is rather pricey. Although these are phenomenal. I'll likely buy them anyway, but hey, if they drop their price I'll buy more than one at a time. These are very dense and quite filling. I was quite stuffed after my burger and power ball. Now these power balls, you may say, ""I can probably make this at home."" But I ask myself, ""Am I really going to do that?"" No, I am not going to do that.

The shop is located on the Mesa and is small but works well. The ordering process is easy and there are a variety of options to choose from.

Whatever's going on in your life, you can be sure that their warm radiant welcome will lift your spirits. Whether you are a daily regular, as I have become, or a newcomer, as I once was, their enthusiasm that you have entered their spectacular oasis to share in it and their food, is unparalleled. They all take immense pride and joy in what they do.

I've often read that food prepared with love infuses that love into what you are eating. I never believed that until eating here. The food is fantastic. There are my favorites, from their Mamma Maca smoothie to the delicious Pesto Panini. Their fresh juices are unparalleled, clean in their taste and flavor combinations. And then there's the daily flavor of banana bread.  The other day I was there when the chef brought out a whole raw apple pie specially ordered for someone's Thanksgiving. She was glowing with pride for her creation, and the care the other women took in boxing it up was a sight to see. It wasn't just a pie, but rather something made special for someone's holiday.

I am vegan so I especially appreciate their vegan offerings. Their menu is organic, gluten-free, and locally sourced. You can really feel and taste the difference between food created at a chain by exhausted workers with cheaply-sourced, chemically-laden products, and food created by people with an exuberance for what they are doing and care in picking the perfect fresh ingredients for it.

Fear not, though, as Bree'osh exceeded everyone's expectations!

It's in a nice spot in Montecito with some outdoor seating and a little parklet area. They were very organized with spaced markers on the ground for distancing. Inside there's just enough room for one party to order at a time. They have a screen up and the payment dongle is on the customer side so it was an easy transaction.

I got a green tea - I could tell from the boxes that it would be high quality and it was. A nice pyramid teabag with just the right amount of leaves and space for them to expand. It sounded like the coffee was pretty good too.

My brother and I both ordered the Croque Madame - which was a good size with a nice side salad. It was delicious - just the right amounts of flaky brioche, creamy bechamel and the egg on top was nice and jammy. My brother felt like they could have used a slightly saltier cheese, which is a fair note.

They offer a Viking Mimosa special (2 for $14) and you can choose either fruit or orange in it! They didn't have the fruit one, so they gave us a blackberry alternative mimosa which was delicious! Not too overwhelmingly sweet and just the right amount of fizz.
They also provide a complimentary apple strudel-like pastry and white bread with butter and orange marmalade. 
I ordered the Hokkabof (like a patty) with poached eggs, and it came with country potatoes, sliced beets, grilled onions, a bacon slice, and an orange slice. My favorite part of the dish was surprisingly the beets. They were really sweet but not too sweet. To be honest, the patty tasted just like a hamburger patty so don't let the name of the entree catch your eye. Personally, I wouldn't order this again.
The smoked salmon entree my friend got was good and had LOTS of cheese on it and a generous amount of smoked salmon (Which she wasn't complaining about). We also got the crab cakes benedict which was DELISH! Andersen's puts their own twist on the benedict by placing a flaky pastry instead of the classic English muffin on their benedict (you can ask to have an English muffin instead, though). The crab cake is so good and every part of the dish has a unique texture to it which adds so much more to the dish. 
The marie antoinette cake slice was so decadent and SUPER thick and rich. There are two types of jam on top of it. It's a little pricey, but definitely something unique and worth trying once in a while :)

Renaud's can be found in Loreto Plaza along State Street and Las Positas. It shares parking with many businesses such as Gelsen's and Chaucer's, but there's plenty of spots.

The bakery menu consists of muffins, macarons, cookies, quiches, chocolates, cakes, pies, petit gâteaus, meringues, and other breads and packaged sweets. Their drink selection is extensive, serving various cold beverages and coffees. 

They also have a bistro menu if you're planning to stay for breakfast or lunch. You can find everything from omelettes to Croque Madame. A few Yelpers have expressed some disappointment with the food, and I can echo this sentiment. Their sandwiches tend to be hit or miss, and I've had a few inconsistent experiences that convinced me it's best to go elsewhere for brunch. 

But their croissants are consistently solid. Renaud's almond croissant is generously encrusted, and they don't skimp on the filling.

Not only is the food incredibly delicious, fresh and gluten-free, but the owner, Rebekah, and her staff are amazing! It was such a delight to have encountered such genuine, warm, friendly people. I will frequent this business not only for the great food, but also to interact with the great people who create and serve it. 

Realizing that a whole day had gone by and I had only eaten an apple and granola bar at 9:00 am for breakfast, I called Boochies at 3:30 pm (30 minutes after closing, mind you) on the off chance that they were still open. At this point, I was not a regular, and had never even been to Boochies before, but, I wanted something healthy, located  nearby, and remembered reading a good Yelp review for Boochies earlier that day, so I wanted to try it. ... I digress. Back to the phone call. Rebekah politely answered the phone and I asked, ""I was wondering if you are actually closed right now?"" She replied pleasantly, that they were closed and were cleaning up, but that I am welcome to come purchase a prepared item from their display case or the mac and cheese. ""I'm a block away and I'll head right over now, thank you!!"" I replied. ""Great, I'll keep an eye out for you"" said Rebekah. (How quickly this has turned into a short story.;)

When I arrived, Rebekah smiled and greeted me, as she unlocked the door. I must say that the space is designed beautifully. Very clean, comfortable, and modern. Think all those great ideas you've pinned on Pinterest in a cafe-style setting. She and her staff did not seem at all frustrated that they had a customer breaking the rules and inconveniencing them. On the contrary, I never felt like an inconvenience at all, even though I know I totally was. I am so grateful to her for accommodating me in my famished state!

As I perused the many freshly prepared options in the display salads, quinoa, baked goods, they chatted it up with me about where I work and answered my questions about nutritional information and what not. I opted for the Raw Kale Avocado Salad and it was heavenly!! Exactly what I needed. Very flavorful and filling. I also had a bit of a sweet tooth so I purchased two vanilla spice mini muffins. Denser than a traditional muffin yet still incredibly moist and naturally sweet. It was the perfect guilt free treat! Total bill $11 - So reasonable!

I will definitely return!...Probably today, even! I want the Raw Kale Avocado Salad again and I'd love to try one of their fresh juices. It looks like Boochies is doing some expanding.

I haven't had anything here I didn't like. Their baguettes have a perfect crispy crust and soft interior. The croissants come in classic, chocolate and almond (my personal favorite) that all are perfectly buttery and ideal for any occasion. All of their pastries are stellar including the eclairs, fruit and lemon tarts, chocolate and fruit bombs, and macaroons.

Not only is it a bakery, but they also offer brunch. I enjoy the American Breakfast with their chicken sausage, two eggs and baguette. If you have a taste for more of a European continental yet carbalicious breakfast, go for the Baker's Basket that comes with a toasted baguette, croissant with butter and jam, fresh squeezed orange juice, and coffee or tea. You can also upgrade your croissant to almond or chocolate for an upcharge. If that's not what you have a taste for, they also have salads, sandwiches (the Croque Monsieur will blow your socks off) and quiche.

Of course I recommend oat milk. I just wish they would stop charging for nondairy milk.

If you're a vegetarian we recommend the omelette with artichoke, mushroom and Gruyère . Omelets is  served with a side salad and two pieces of their delicious bread

Their mushroom cheese croissant with bechamel  sauce is also a hit.

Not a fan  of their chocolate chip cookie thing but it's in a shape that invites a scoop of ice cream

I've never tried their entrees, per se, but have indulged in several of their pastries. They are delicious! Fluffy, moist and flavorful, just as I like. I'm a big fan of their soft pretzels with cheese baked in - a great flavor combo. 

Although this shop is busy (and fairly awkward to navigate through as it's small and narrow), the staff always appear to be at the ready. There are several of them working the bar at any given time and I feel that they do a good job with keeping the line moving.

The breakfast sandwich was really nice with the highlight being the brioche bread of course! The star of the show though, was really the morning bun: perfectly flaky and fluffy with plenty of cinnamon sugar.

After viewing some great food pics for Bree'osh on Yelp, I bookmarked it and decided to give it whirl this morning. Little did I know, I was in for a wonderful treat and great start to my day. 

Bree'osh is tucked away in a popular strip mall on Montecito's Coast Village Road. It was formerly the home of Crush Cakes. The shop is quaint and inviting with four tables and two umbrellas outside, and two cozy booths with a small high-top bar and stools inside. 

There is a black chalk board on the wall scribed with a vast selection of fresh baked pastries, sandwiches and coffee drinks. 

I was greeted at the counter by a gorgeous, young woman with a lovely French accent who appears to be one of the owners based on a photograph from an article on Bree'osh framed on their wall. 

I explained to her that I was debating between the Bacon & Cheese Brioche and Almond Creme Brioche. She showed me both and described a few other items as well. I ordered the Almond Creme Brioche because it is a house specialty and paired it with a small cup of coffee from Handlebar Roasting Company. 

Based on aesthetics alone, I thought the brioche might be dry, but boy was I wrong. The outside of the brioche is baked to a crispy, golden perfection and topped with crunchy toasted almond slivers. It appears to be finished off with a light egg wash prior to baking so their is a beautiful shine to the bread. Just beneath the crusty exterior, are layers, upon layers of moist, flaky bread - almost like a croissant but slightly more dense. The Almond Creme Brioche is served cut in half with a house made ""almond creme"" sandwiched in the centered. This creme is like nothing I have ever tasted. I tend to associate the word creme with milky or butter based products. Bree'oshs' almond creme is nothing like that and does not appear to be made with any milk or cream at all. The texture is similar to what I imagine the love child of honey and apple sauce would be if they could have a baby. It's difficult for me to describe, but trust me, it's outstanding! 

I cannot wait to go back and try more varieties of brioche! It has been a few hours since I consumed my tasty treat and I am still full! Despite it's petite appearance, a brioche is actually quite filling and fairly priced around $4 and some change. 

I highly recommend Bree'osh. C'est magnifique!",2015-11-04 19:34:26

Butter ring: twirls of egg yolk and butter rich Danish pastry dough with FLECKS OF VANILLA BEANS IN IT, ok?! And a custardy, not too sweet, marzipan-y filling with a dollop of basic icing to top it all off. 

French waffle: unique item I've not seen before. Crispy eclair-shaped pastries that are similar to palmier (or perhaps the same as?) with crunchy sugary crust sandwiching an ever so light layer of fresh tasting raspberry jam and a thick sweetened whipped cream filling

Carrot cake whoopie pie: soft and slightly sweet raisin, oat, carrot, cinnamon checked cookie filled with a delightful cream cheese frosting  that was heavier on the tangy cream cheese than butter (which I prefer)

Apple Kringle: really nice if you love apple pie and marzipan. Nice and not typical for me to have the two together. Same lovely golden tinged vanilla bean dough 

Rum ball: super delicious! Do you remember those chocolate balls they used to serve at the ikea deli back in the day? They're like those but much higher quality ingredients with bittersweet chocolate sprinkles on the outside. Great toothsome texture and good chocolate used.

By contrast, I'd never even seen this market until Matt B. suggested we go to pick up a few odd things we needed for the week.

It's a cute place with some comfortable neighborhood charm, and I enjoyed the ample parking and calm, quiet atmosphere. Obviously, the stock was more limited than at a supermarket--we couldn't find the pasta we wanted and did end up making a Von's run later in the week--but we picked up some of the items on our list, including a few bottles of wine. The wine selection was solid, with lots of local/regional wines. Definitely extensive enough that you'll walk away with what you need if you're not looking for anything too specific. (Our toddler, who was just learning his colors, pointed to a wall of reds and said, ""Red? Red?"") The cheese/deli section was pretty enticing, too.

The ambiance on the outdoor patio is warm and inviting; overlooking State Street. It's reminiscent of a European bistro with an emphasis on Danish treats.

My favorite breakfast entree comes from the healthy side of the menu featuring house made sausage, quinoa, veggies, egg and sour cream. It's an unlikely pairing that creates a winning flavor combination. My husband loves the sausage omelet. It is savory, hearty and delicious.

The Quinoa Mac N' Cheese is not as good as it used to be. It was perfection and now it is often inconsistent and tastes more like a science experiment. The last few times I've ordered it, there were massive pieces of raw garlic cloves, big chunks of raw cauliflower and a liquid of soupy consistency. These elements were better incorporated in the past and created a much more balanced dish. 

The Kale and Avocado Salad, while just okay now, was previously extraordinary. I can't quite pinpoint what the changes are but the recipe definitely is not the recipe that I came to love when Green Table was Boochies or Green Table was Green Table with different co-ownership.

Of course with new ownership comes change, and change can be a great thing. It's just tough when great things are changed for not so great things. 

I like the front of the house staff. They are sweet and provide good customer service. I do miss the warm, energetic and hospitable energy that the previous owner cultivated in the restaurant. There was often a line out the door and people packed shoulder to shoulder inside. I think that was a testament not just to the wonderful, healthy food but the inviting, personable experience customers had there as well. It's much different now. Ownership/management can rarely be seen interacting with their guests or staff, but can be found sitting a dining table entranced by their laptops for hours on end. They're probably doing necessary administrative tasks, it is just a dramatic culture shift from its predecessor. 

I am impressed with the ongoing expansion of the menu, however. It seems Green Table is really trying to expound upon what they inherited from Boochies and create innovative, exciting menu items. That's fantastic! I look forward to trying their new dishes and perhaps see a return of the crowd favorites that garnered their original popularity.",2017-04-08 15:38:22

They have two locations one by state street and this one that where they roast their coffee as well as serve breakfast.

After visiting both locations I prefer this one.  It is very popular and their are a lot of great food items to eat.   I didn't have any food, but I did try two of their coffee items.  The first item that I had to try is their espresso shake.   It is there espresso mixed with you guessed it, ice cream.  My initial impression is the serving size is small compared to what you get (8 dollars yikes!)  Moving aside from the value the shake is pretty good.  The best thing about it are the little pieces of espresso beans ground up into the shake.   This make for a nice version of a coffee shake.  The second drink I had was a vanilla ice latte.  I wouldn't say the best latte I've had, but still a really good latte.

-Usually a long line/wait

He was polite, helpful, and treated us as if we were the Hotel's favorite guests. After much deliberation, we were sitting at a high-top marble table sharing a generous slide of goat cheese cake. I had an expertly crafted machiato and Edwin brought us a chilled kraffe of water and two glasses. Yes the prices are a bit more than what we are used to paying at the local donut shop, but this is an environment worth the premium. I will be back with a newspaper for a lingering breakfast.

It feels spacious and chill, with a clean, industrial vibe. The counter servers seemed more like hosts in their own home than employees. The women who made my latte asked me to taste it first as she handed it over. She warned me it might be pretty intense because of the none-fat milk.

We will definitely go back to the bakery, and hope that these suggestions for their main fare are implemented.",2018-02-08 23:51:18

First off, asking someone to create such an important piece for a wedding is already enough pressure and Sam was completely understanding and worked with for our exact needs.

We just went downtown to buy a mirror.  We saw the farmers market and thought, hey, let go and pick up dinner after we get the mirror...  On our way back from acquiring the mirror, we saw The Book Ends Cafe* sign out on the sidewalk in front of Antioch University.   Thought, hey, its lunch time, let drop by after the market and try it out... at the market we get local ridgeback shrimp that was landed at the dock at 5:30 that morning.  Im thinking this day cant get any better.  Back to the Book Ends Cafe we had one of the best sandwiches we've had in memory, Lemony Chickpea on this amazing bread, in fact I could have been eating about anything with that bread and it would have been amazing!    I asked the owner of the place, where do you get the amazing bread.... ""well, its a great little local bakery over on Reddick St.""...  so off we went... the adventure continues...

Then were driving down this side street thinking ok, where is this place, Deux Bakery.  We pulled up in front, didn't look like much but all I cared about was getting my hands on a loaf of this bread that I had so many plans for already.  Wendy, the owner, and Jesse, the baker, where there working away.  Being a self taught bread baker I had many questions for the both of them.  Jessie ended up given us a tour of the back when he found out I like to bake.   It interesting to see the interworking of Deux.  I only wish I had more than one stomach to enjoy all the offerings.  

The only down side of finding Deux is now I have very little motivation to bake my own bread now,  I guess I will figure out something to do with all that free time.

Visited Santa Barbara with a friend for a few days and stumbled upon this place looking up good restaurants on Yelp. Was not disappointed. Craft donuts made fresh daily with flavors changing seasonally. No preservatives. Tried the burnt honey & rosemary, brown butter and samoa the first day, they were so good we went back a second day to try the blueberry crisp and strawberry habanero. All of them were soooo delicious, no joke. The blueberry was probably my favorite though. If you're ever in the area do yourself a favor and go here.

But I decided to just hover by the bar area overlooking the coffee roasting machine, and it was a nice experience.

I have been doing this for about 10 years now and this place is now one of my favorites and have visited twice on our trip, good grief point me to gym right, nah F it, I'M ON VACATION! .
.
What seals it was the approval of E who doesn't prefer a donut and she was all excited like me. As you all know it is hard for a trained palate(the baker she is) to like certain things, but she loves them like me.
.
What makes it so good? A donut is a donut right? Oh on the contrary. The donut has to be light, the dough just right with the touch of sweetness. Not greasy as most places leave the donuts in the oil too long. Then you have the flavors and toppings. The combination this guy Banker turned Baker does it just right. The true test is if you can make a simple glazed right, then the rest will follow. Here his base was a browned butter glazed donut and OMG!

Done! Enough said! Carry on with your day!

One stuffed with lemon curd and topped with a light glaze and crumbled shortbread cookies and a chocolate peanut butter one. The former didn't make it past Summerland on my way home.

Can we all just take a moment to appreciate how much time it takes to make a good donut?

You have to make the dough and kneed and kneed and kneed, let it rise. Roll out and let rise again and then fry. Add on top of that each individual topping and the care and quality that goes into it. You can tell these recipes have been tweaked and perfected for years before they opened. 

Spudnuts and ellers shouldn't even be part of the conversation. There is no comparison! 

$3.25 is a fair price. These are quality ingredients, a hard working husband and wife team and lease space on state street. How much do you pay for a frozen, dried out scone that probably travels from a warehouse in the Midwest at Starbucks? at least that much or more. 

The only constructive feedback I have is that the interior could feel a little more lively, welcoming and festive inside. It's a little quiet and muted, staff is a little slow and cautious, but I think that will come in time. 

The donuts are perfect and that's the most important part. They have the opportunity to make some lifelong memories with Santa Barbara families. This could become a special place, a quintessential Santa Barbara stop!!!!",2018-10-28 16:54:32

We ordered a couple of each of: chocolate creme brûlée , pineapple Dole whip, s'mores and animal cracker. The creme brûlée was everyone's top pick. That crunchy sugar top was everything. All of the other flavors were tied for second depending on who you talked to in our family, but they were all absolute winners! We discovered they only make a certain amount each day so the best way to get what you want is to order the day before. They also change up the flavors so you can try new ones or wait for a favorite to come around again. The donuts themselves were just so soft and yeasty and delicious, a perfect foil for all of the yummy toppings. We chose curbside pick up and a really nice young man brought them out to us. Oh yes, they also have dog cookies in the shape of donuts that are adorable and our pup felt very spoiled. Just an all around perfect experience and one I would highly recommend!",2020-08-31 05:00:02

It's not unreasonable and I feel it's worth paying up a bit to enjoy the bistro elegance and trendy and well stocked restrooms. The wine averages $15 a glass, the beer around $8.00, and the food for around $16 a plate. For two, with a glass of wine, expect to spend around $60. Brunch is served until 3:00, and then happy hour begins. They serve fresh salads, bowls, and unique plates of food. You can also order sides or appetizers.

I also was in awe of the Super Seed Cookie the first time I tried it. Again, can't buy cookies because of the allergy so what a special treat.  However, I will have to say that the cookies have been hit and miss.  Sometimes they simply don't taste good at all!  Way off to the point of throwing it out but when you pay $4.00 for a cookie plus a tip you choke it down anyway.  I talked to a friend about this and she suggested that dates go bad and that was probably why the cookies were sometime not so good.  Also it seems the consistency of recipe for this one seems to be off.  The 1st time I had it the sweetness was amazing and the cinnamon notes were just awesome subsequent purchases were just so, so in this regard.

Hoping that you can do something to move your customer line a little faster.  Arriving at 9:08 and having to stand in line for 30 minutes for 1 item is a bit of a bummer.  This is even being number 8 in line.  I would imagine that you are loosing a great deal of business because people just don't want to stand there that long.  Why you started serving coffee I will never understand! This addition only exacerbates the long SLOW line. I wish I had a suggestion how to streamline your process at checkout.  Maybe your brilliant bakers and staff can come up with a solution.  Seems like you might need a second window or a larger facility. Not a bad problem to have.  :-)

Maybe ask the customer if they are having coffee 1st thing when they walk up.  Call out to someone else to make the coffee while the nice young woman at the front continues with the bread order. 

Thanks again!",2021-03-13 18:22:17

Food rating 5 stars.  Clearly they are passionate about ingredients, combinations and presentation.  Food locally sourced and bread/pastries all made in-house.  Pricing is on the expensive side, so don't go there if you are cheap; Sambos will be more your style.

Service: 2 stars.  Although you order at the counter ala Jeanines, you have to wait for them to bring waters.  Coffee came after our meals, and food runner couldn't see our number which was right on the table.  Coffee served in a paper to go cup, even though we ate there and spent $40 for two of us. Refills on water were impossible, and dirty tables stayed dirty throughout our meal.  Register had no change as someone forgot to go to bank.  Although they have front of the house staff, no one seems to understand what that entails.  Clearly the person who did the hiring was overly focused on back of the house.
Recommendations: Have self-service water station.  Go to Jeanines to see how efficient this works.  Have a standard where dirty tables cleaned within one minute of vacancy.  Food runners should have table numbers in their head, before the orders come out.  Prioritize coffee and pastry orders.  Make sure no buildup of the line....use both registers.  Put menus by the station where line forms, not at the order location too late for people to read.  Put more of your main breakfast items on the board somewhere, as hard to see you have full breakfast menu....we almost left before investigating.  For back of house have a separate order ticket printer so they don't have to be called out by the expediter.  Food runner can also have tickets to monitor, but no reason not to print a duplicate directly to the cooks.

We will be back, but please make these basic changes.",2017-09-23 18:53:49

Handlebar Roasters will go down in history for me as the best coffee in SB. It is everything I want in a latte; rich, creamy espresso with a hint of chocolatey background and warm tones of woodsiness released in the breathe after ingesting. Not too acidic, yet strong in it's caffeine presence. Sensually aromatic, yet doesn't make you smell like an artificial candle after ingesting and/or leaving the premises. 

It mixes well with regular, soy, and (my personal preference) oat milk. It tastes good in all forms, my recommendations being the regular iced latte and the affogato. It gives you the perfect buzz for a healthy amount of time. And it roasts well at home when you buy their bags of beans to go. 

This Handlebar location has matcha, chai, charcoal, and turmeric lattes, as well. They also carry a wide variety of cold salads, avocado toast, chocolate croissants, bagels, cookies, artisanal donuts, almond croissants, and so much more. Breakfast is served until 2 pm (or as supplies last) and sometimes they have theme nights with craft local chefs coming in and serving things like ramen and tacos. 

This location is a lot bigger than the downtown location, though there are no outlets to plug in. Just charge up the laptop in advance and come enjoy the strong wifi, vast amount of seating options indoor and out, and delicious espresso + loaded avo toast. Heck, you can even grab a beer and work here, as this location has select beers on tap. Stay tuned for exclusive flavor releases!

There is a small private lot right next to the coffee shop, tons of street parking on or near De La Vina, and the Presto Pasta shopping center lot right next door if you're just popping in for a quick bite/drink.

Thought they would be unable to make my order for Xmas day so I asked about Xmas eve. To my surprise they had no problem doing a pick up for Xmas morning. My mother in law is vegan so I wanted to get something that she could eat and everyone could enjoy! If you didn't know they were vegan doughnuts you would never be able to tell! Very tasty! They were so amazing! They let me customize the flavors as well which I thought was awesome. Overall they are well worth the money and would highly recommend if your looking to treat your family or yourself to something nice. Thanks again for all you did for us! Look forward to using you guys again in the future!,2018-12-30 20:07:29

Service: The servers were pleasant but weren't the most attentive. We didn't get our water until we asked them twice after our food and coffee had already came. Overall it was kinda slow, but they also run a cafe inside the restaurant (so the servers are also busy with the cafe orders), so it's understandable.

They open at 8 AM Wed-Mon til 2 PM or until they sell out! I got there around 8:15 AM this past Friday and there was already a nice line inside. They have eight flavors right now:
PB & J, Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake, Fig & Honey, Apple Cobbler, POG, Browned Butter, Mexican Hot Chocolate, and Vanilla Bean + donut holes!
*Their flavors will change based on season!

By the time I got to the front, it was 8:55 AM and they had already sold out of the Pumpkin Pie Cheesecake, Apple Cobbler and Mexican Hot Chocolate! :(

I ordered one of each of the flavors that were left. They are yeast raised donuts and they were all delicious! There wasn't one I didn't like. 

PB & J:
Peanut butter glaze and house made blackberry jam glaze

Fig & Honey:
Fig glaze, San Marcos Farms honey glaze and pistachio

POG:
Passion fruit-orange-guava glaze, hibiscus sugar and Flora Vista Farms edible flower

Browned Butter:
Browned butter glaze and Maldon sea salt

Vanilla Bean:
Classic yeast raised donut with vanilla bean glaze

A little pricey, yes. But they use local ingredients and THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. 100% worth a try.
*They currently do not have any gluten free or vegan donuts.

Their first three days of opening, they sold out within ~2 hours of opening. If you want to get your hands on some of them, get there before they open and wait in line, especially if you're aiming for the flavors they sold out of while I was there!

They also serve Dark Horse coffee, Two Leaves and A Bud hot tea and Ghirardelli hot chocolate!

And don't worry, they are working on figuring out how to make more donuts, so that they don't sell out in just a couple of hours! Not a bad problem to have, though. ;)
*They've been able to make more donuts and the lines aren't as crazy! Aka just go and eat some donuts!!

Love the creativity in the flavors though. The apple crumble tasted like apple pie in a donut (yum!) but was also super sweet (not so yummy). The mexican cocoa gave just a smidge of a spicy kick to an otherwise boring chocolate glazed donut.

I had the brown butter donuts and I didn't realize that it had a bite of salt to it which was actually refreshing because most brown butters are usually basic, but this one really stood out to me as compared to other brown butter items. They serve Dune coffee I believe which is a recognizably good coffee so that also stands out well. The cashier was very friendly the space itself I wasn't crazy about because they share it with a couple other businesses so you have to make sure that you know what line you're standing in and who to order from  because there was a few people who were confused about that having said that it was still a great experience. I went a little late in the day so there weren't as many options as a morning person probably would have to choose from having said that I still enjoyed what I got and I can't wait to try the next doughnut.",2019-01-29 08:21:41

Soon, our food was delivered, and let me tell you, it was beautiful. On top of that, it was scrumptious. The fried chicken was perfect and tender. The waffle had the perfect balance of crunch and fluff. And how dare I forget the exquisite honey. Now this honey was the best I have ever tasted. It was topped with chia and pumpkin seeds. My daughter asked for her croissant warmed, and once again it was marvelous. After paying, I told our waitress how amazing the honey was.

Handlebar gets their pastries from Reynaud's bakery, and also has a good selection of sandwiches or other brunch items. We had stopped at Reynaud's earlier in the morning, so did not indulge in the pastries, but I have every confidence that they would be delicious. 

The most standout part of our experience at Handlebar may have been the service. The baristas were all friendly and extremely helpful. Once we had our coffee, we were sitting off to the side, eating our pastries (not purchased on site) out of their boxes. One of the employees was kind enough to bring us two plates, making it much easier to eat. Another employee cleared them when we were done, without us having to ask for assistance either time.

Well one day I was in a juice shop in town and ordered Avo toast which came on a bread that came from this bakery and ever since I'm a converted bakeriette if such a thing exists.

In the old days you could walk in this place almost empty and smell all of the wonderful breads stacked up next to each other to throw your nostril at. But now that's all changed, you know  like the toilet paper and soap thing in 2020 -- so even if I try my best to show up at 9 am I'm looking at lines of people eating to get some of their goodies. Like a 20-30 minute wait on a Saturday morning. 

So all this writing talk but what the deal with why this bread is so good.  First off it's made freshly every day and they are not afraid to use a lot of of whole grains and gluten free flours so that anyone can find something interesting.  Most are vegan too except for a few that have cheese. 

My favorites here are the superseed. That bread lasts for weeks as it's so dense. Great triple  toasted  with nut butter on top GF. They are gluten free they also make a superseed cookie that is pretty phenomenal too.  I also like their sage garlic in either gluten free or regular, the shiitake shallot.  I'm more on the savory spectrum but if you like more sweeter option they have those too. Heck they even have a charcoal bread for those needing a bit of a detox;)

Prices are crazy high here I see people throwing out $100 bills without a hitch.  I suck it up and throw out the CC and then they will ask you what kind of tip if any you would like to give to the bakers of course not the servers.  Bravo to the bakers.  

Don't mess around folks. Get here early, be patient,  bring the wallet and when you are at home biting into your sliced triple toasted slice of bread you will realize that the smile it gave you was worth every dollar. Thanks",2021-02-27 16:26:39

The POG (passion fruit, orange, guava) and pomegranate rose are by far my favorites of the ones I've tried. They were refreshing, light, and sweet!

Yet, as I've come in more often, most of the flavors are just okay. The chocolate flavors in particular, struggle to have any complex flavors or sweetness. The Mexican cocoa was too spicy and the browned butter far too salty!  Unfortunately the doughnuts only differ in the icing/toppings.

It's a little pricey too. $3.25 is quite a bit more than the average doughnut. On weekdays, they have a good deal of $5 coffee + doughnut, but the coffee isn't good enough to make it worthwhile.",2018-12-20 14:25:50

Over the last 6 months I've become totally in love with visiting Oat Bakery. The phenomenal staff is incredibly kind and authentically welcoming. You can sense their genuine love for what they create and their appreciation for their customers. Everything here is done artfully. Each item is carefully created. The entire menu boasts flavor, texture, aroma and is also incredibly aesthetically pleasing. I stopped eating store bought bread/crackers/pasta 10+ years ago. I always bloated and felt super inflamed, weighed down and even grumpy so I cut out the gluten and never looked back. Until a friend insisted we visit here last November. Despite a lot of reluctance, I caved less than a hour after she bought her goods. The smell was driving me crazy in the best way! Expecting the bloat to hit like a brick, I still kept eating. Almost the entire focaccia loaf! I couldn't stop even despite knowing how I was going to feel. Well guess what! It never happened. Not after eating. Not that night. Not when I woke the next morning. I was shocked! But certainly not mad. Oat is a must at least once a week but ideally 2! Try everything. It's all so good, I promise! You can taste and feel the love in each bite. In our world, There's thrift store clothes and there's Chanel. There's Hyundai's and there's Ferraris. There's store bought bread and there's Oat. There is simply no comparison. If you appreciate craft, luxury, innovation and heart felt energy put into your foods, this is your place. My mom recently went to grab a loaf of bread from Lazy Acres and I bout had a heart attack in the store and insisted we drove downtown if she wanted bread. She said ""there's literally a wall of bread right in front of us.""  I said ""this is not bread. It just looks like it. You want bread? We're going downtown!"" She was a bit confused by my passion. Then we arrived. All doubts were laid to rest upon just seeing their beautiful display box. I'm telling you, Oat is a a true GEM!! The 6 Star Luxury Resort of Baked Goods.

The rest are probably best shared on a different site ;^)

First, the appealing bits:
Large; I'd say cavernous space with only the front third or so for indoor seating for maybe 40? There's outdoor seating available as well.
Lots of fresh bakery choices and specialty items like Avo Toast ($10).
Friendly and solicitous staff :^D
Oh, did I mention their Damn Good Coffee? Yep.

Not so appealing?
Noise level is high-ish, since the floors and walls are bare, so the acoustics are pretty 'live', which makes it a little more of a strain to converse casually at times, but this is just a small issue.
Prices are on par with many popular coffee shops, but some of the baked goods and avocado toast are well beyond the scope of someone with a limited budget.

Maybe the pastry might have been good, but I think where it went wrong was when I requested to have it heated. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems as though it was microwaved instead of toasted/baked. So the pastry dough came out chewy and a bit rubbery instead of crispy and flakey. Even cutting it with a knife was tough, so imagine what chewing it was like. So beware if you're there and you're hungry.

The location is great and the interior space is open with lots of natural light. But there is limited parking and it can get quite noisy inside. Lots of people coming and going which is great if you're hanging out and people watching, but not so great if you're trying to concentrate on something.

There was a strawberry and a chocolate cut into pieces for tasting and then a variety of their adorably decorated donut holes for purchase. The chocolate vegan donut is where it's at, though. After one bite of thick, rich chocolatey heaven I was caught in a trans and found it very hard to believe they were vegan made. The strawberry was not as tasty as the chocolate, and a little on the dry side, but I figured it was just hard to follow up such a decadent chocolate dessert. 

At the event there were also bits and pieces of their cookie varieties for sampling. Though I can't recall if there were multiple flavors or not, I do remember trying and loving the few bites I got of the chocolate chunk cookie. It had a nice crumble to it, not too dry but not doughy and dense, with a good ratio of chocolate chunks to dough.

With over 15k followers on Instagram, Hook & Press is anything but your standard donut shop. You can't go wrong with their classic browned butter where the game changing flaky Maldon sea salt enhances that browned butter flavor. Over the years, I've also enjoyed lemon lavender, coastal fog (black tea with whipped cream), animal cracker, Mexican hot cocoa, POG, cinnamon crumb, samoa, matcha coconut, blood orange creamsicle, cereal milk, gingerbread cheesecake (festive and yum!), vanilla peppermint, pineapple Dole Whip, POG (tart and tropical!), filled chocolate creme brûlée (the donut's exterior was covered in hardened caramelized sugar like the top of a creme brûlée-pretty fun!), and filled everything bagel (this savory one was funky for me, but I appreciate their effort).

Because the menu changes every so often, I know I'll be returning in the future to try new flavors, so I like that they have a rewards program called ""Sprinkles"" where you earn 1 sprinkle for every $1 spent. Twenty sprinkles gives you $1 off your entire sale, thirty sprinkles gives you $2 off any beverage, and fifty sprinkles gives you a free donut. I'd recommend pre-ordering after 3pm the day before for pickup the following day to ensure you get all the flavors you want because the donuts sell out pretty quickly, especially on the weekends.

In fact I think this is my go to spot to get coffee drinks as it's consistent and I'm rarely let down.  I also like the outdoor seating here and I'm never rushed so I can get some work done or just sit out in the sun to enjoy life's little pleasures. 

This place reminds me of a like a Napa Valley specialty foods shop and coffee bar all in one.  If you want to check out some of the most advanced brewing equipment I've ever seen before this is your place   They sell interesting bottles of red and white locally made wines.  The produce they sell is pretty eclectic and is fun to brows through.  I saw pasta, different balsamics, gluten free flours and brownie mixes, bags of rice,  alternative milks in cases, and even some locally made vinegars of sorts.  They also have a whole line of their cups and mugs.  I bought one as I like the shape of it and it fits in my car smaller size coffee cup holder:)

My go to here is an Americano and I add an extra shot with half water and half steamed almond milk. I ask for cinnamon on top as I go nuts for cinnamon in everything.  Normally they use 2 shots for their medium coffee so when you add an extra shot they double that taking it to 4 shots total.  Trust me it's worth adding the extra shot.  I've also had their Dirty Chai and Macha, and Charcoal Latte and  all have been outstanding.  They do get busy and have a lot of staff working so they have once in a while messed up my order but that is rare.  Also note is I recommend you ask for extra hot if you're like me and like to have your drink stay warm for longer. I have had to one time have them remake my drink because it was lukewarm:(  I also bring a thermal mug to store mine so it even lasts longer but that's just me.

Service is always pretty efficient here even though lines can go out the door.  But there is always tables so that's good and you can also kill time browsing their stuff while you wait for your drink.  Also note their is some interesting food options that are inside the coffeehouse, most are not vegan but they have a Avo toast and salads you can modify.  They house a pop up of modern Asian Korean food but have never checked out but saw they make a maitake mushroom Bao that looked interesting.

Slightly smoky from the bacon, a little salty, and sweet. You could definitely taste the maple but it was subtle. It was a nice surprise to see little bits of bacon inside the biscuit as well.

The cinnamon roll was also delicious warmed up. I don't like an overly sweet icing but the icing on the cinnamon roll was perfect.

I was actually surprised when initially I saw 3 stars. I decided to try it for myself and my hubby since the place looks so inviting. We ordered the PROTEIN FRITTATA. It has cracked eggs, hearts of palm, sweet piquillo peppers, foraged mushrooms, and aged cheddar.  It was delicious and satisfying! And I'm always a sucker for mushrooms. We also got the SMOKED SALMON TOAST. It has everything cream cheese, tomatoes, onions, capers, tomatoes on sourdough. Both delicious and filling to fuel up our Urban Wine Walk in the Funk Zone. 

And their latte was soooo fresh, tasty, and well balanced!! I never had to put sugar and it wasn't lukewarm. Two signs of a great cup of java! 
 
We also got a hazelnut-chocolate dessert from their bakery and it was delicious and decadent! 

Service was wonderful! Wait was probably 10 minutes to get a table. Since the waitstaff checked in on us consistently I rarely had to flag them down.

Since July 4th was approaching i thought: hmmmm, maybe a Pie would make more sense as dessert than a proverbial Cake.
So i ordered a Lemon Cream and a lattice top Apple.
A very polite woman took my order via telephone and promised the pies for july 3rd, mid morning.
Apple Pie
Lemon Cream Pie
The apples were slightly crisp, slightly sweetened  though lacking natural syrup caused by over baking i assume. This is a shame in that the apples are delicious but a pie needs juices and this one had almost none.
The crust was likewise delicious but it was way over baked: so much so that the crust was stuck to the pie pan making it difficult to slice.
So how do I evaluate this pie? Good but not as excellent as it might have been had the pie not been over-baked.
Over baking caused the apples to lose most of their innate syrup and the crust to be not moist enough.
On the other hand the Lemon Cream was superior with both  crust baked expertly and the lemon filling obviously jam packed with real lemon taste and not sweetened to distraction. Obviously lots of fresh lemon juice and lemon peel were used to make the filling and not too much sugar which in my book detracts from the natural lemon taste of a lemon.
The cream topping was fluffy and speckled with fresh lemon peel . VERY Good Stuff.
Hit and Miss at Deux today but I will definitely be back. And i will definitely order another Apple Pie.",2019-07-04 23:09:28

I was there Sunday morning and the line was pretty crazy, which made me wonder why they didn't have more than one person boxing up donuts, but it moved at a pretty good pace. I got one of each for a gathering of friends at the Rose Garden, plus another couple to make an even dozen. Favorites of the group were the pumpkin pie, the browned butter, and the pumpkin spice latte (go figure). ""Misses"" - and it's still a donut so it's not like I gagged - included the POG, the caramel apple, and the Twix.

Their espresso is full-bodied, somewhere between a medium and a dark and little flowery. No matter how you have it, it shines through. The vanilla latte was perfectly sweet. The macchiato was very rich, definitely a premier drink for sipping. The scoop of ice cream used in the affogato was extremely luscious and creamy, yet in spite of this, the boldness of their coffee still made a statement. I also really appreciated the sprinkling of espresso powder they threw on top of the affogato which added an extra flavor dimension. Handlebar also roasts beans right on site as evident from the equipment which takes up most of the real estate in this spacious store. The amount of natural light that's let in also makes this spot a comfortable place to work, study or chill.

Their bread is dense and delicious with unique ingredients you don't normally find at a bread shop/bakery. 

Ordered:
-house coffee with oat milk = 3/5. I was ignorant and asked for half and half. Hello! The place is called Oat Bakery they use oat milk! Lol. The coffee was decent. My mom wasn't used to oat milk so she only finished half. Would I get coffee here next time? If I didn't have time, yes, but I would prefer going up the street to Caje or Dune. 
-shiitake/shallot = 5/5. Delicious and the mushrooms are a nice touch! I was skeptical on the mushrooms. I thought it would provide too much moisture to the bread loaf but it makes for great flavor and texture.
-sage/garlic = 3/5. Nothing special flavor wise. I would probably not get this again.
-date/something salty? = 6/5. I wish I remembered what seasonal bread we ordered the first time we visited. It was a Tuesday and there was a loaf with dates and something salty. This loaf was the reason why we came back! Since we visited on a Sunday they didn't have anything seasonal",2021-09-13 16:26:54

This place is small and the store itself also has Buena Onda so hook and press is near the middle/back.

They have a beautiful display of donuts and some of the flavors rotate in and out. I got 6 donuts (the blueberry pancake, the coastal fog, browned butter, the apple fritter, the lemon lavender, and the everything bagel) I wanted to try a bunch of flavors so I got a box and split with friends

Lemon Lavender: (4/5) I was really excited for this one which is a new flavor. It was a tad too sweet for me but the lavender flavor really shined through and its topped with little bits of lavender. There's a slight lemon aftertaste as well thats not too strong

Blueberry Pancake: (5/5) This one might be my favorite! It really tasted like a pancake and I loved the blueberry icing. It  was also quite sweet so I could only eat a little at a time but I kept wanting more!! 

Apple Fritter: (5/5) This apple fritter is only available on Fridays and I wish that wasn't the case because it is so DELISH. It seems simple but the texture and the bits of apple are sooo yummy. 

Everything Bagel: (4/5) I don't know why but I thought this one would be sweet...well it's not! It's a bit salty with cream cheese inside and I enjoyed it as a reprieve from all the sugar

Coastal Fog: (5/5) I forget what flavor this really is but it's delicious! (maybe a tea of some sort?) and it has a scrumptious whipped cream on top

Browned butter: (3.5/5) a bit too sweet for my liking and reminded me a bit of a cookie. You can really taste the brown butter flavor though.

The service was really friendly but not the fastest. I would love if they had a sampler so I could try them all but not buy an entire donut HAHA oh well...guess I'll just have to but the entire thing",2021-04-09 22:31:32

Be prepared for the $3.25 price, but THEY ARE WORTH IT! I love anything blood orange, so, that flavor was a must do for me. They also have a Mexican chocolate donut that is just as amazing with a bit of a kick...we were warned ahead of time (which was really nice). My friend got the Everything Bagel donut, and just wow...only way better than an actual bagel! The outdoor seating was perfect and their black coffee hot and strong! This place is legit for donuts. And if you are going to eat the calories, you might had well come here, cause these calories are worth it!

Blueberry Pancake - Maple custard filled, with a blueberry glaze and fresh blueberries to top it off
Chocolate Four Ways - The four ways are: 1. Dark chocolate glaze, 2. A sprinkle of cacao nibs, 3. Dashes of ganache, and 4. Chocolate buttercream whip in the middle.
Coastal Fog - Tea infused glaze, cream, and mint
Blood Orange Creamsicle - Blood orange everything with vanilla stripes
Cinnamon Crumb - Cinnamon glaze with a crumbly vanilla brown butter topping
Everything Bagel Donut - Cream cheese filled, with a bit of seasoning on top

Taste-wise, the doughnuts were pretty fluffy and fresh even when not immediately eaten. As creative as they are, I wish there was more ""variation"" so to speak. Yes they have a couple with fillings, but the vast majority of their menu is the same glazed yeast-raised ring with a different candied fruit on top or something slightly altered. After a couple bites, the flavors just mix in my mouth and they all taste the same. It would be cool to see them include a couple cake doughnuts, or offer their unique twist on the cruller, or add a reimagined old-fashioned to the mix.

Their menu is ever-changing, which keeps things interesting. Definitely the most eye-catching doughnuts on the market, I'm going to have to make a stop here myself to bring a box to the office!",2021-03-21 08:56:41

Well reviewed but off the usual Santa Barbara tourist path. Small storefront without any seating that I saw but this may be due to current Covid restrictions. Walk-in and you can see right back into the back where one of the bakers(owners?)was turning out scratch pie crusts to be filled with deliciousness I'm sure. At the counter you can see what they have in the way of fresh breads, pastries, cookies, muffins, etc. And in the cooler behind, cupcakes, brownies and more. So after some intense questioning, I chose a chocolate truffle cookie-which I didn't see in the online menu-a carrot cake cupcake, and slab of banana bread. Such a slab I was able to cut through the middle and have slices with two breakfasts. It was wonderfully moist with lots of flavor and a really  nice crispy edge. One of the best I've had. And this wasn't even the best Item! It's very rare when we hit a bakery we find more than once in our travels so, after eating the cupcake and the cookie outside their door, when we chose to go back in for one more of each you know they had to be good. The cookie was moist and rich and almost brownie like with a nice crackly outside edge. It may have had a little caramel in it, I should have asked. Just delicious. The cupcake was the STAR of the show. Carrot cake can be prepared in so many different ways. This was made with raisins and walnuts(?)and delicious homemade icing. Probably cream cheese. The icing quantity may have been to much for some but we loved it. The cupcake, similarly to many bakeries creating from scratch, was kept in the cooler. And most bakery seekers like me know this chill can deaden some flavors and speed up loss of moisture creating dry product. For whatever reason this was not the case with the carrot cake. Moist, bursting with flavor, and downright spectacular IMO. And once we returned home with the second one, and ate it at room temp, even better. The experience and love these bakers have for their work shows up big time. I hope that anyone who reads this and can will try them out as soon as possible. Places like this need our business in these times. I cannot recommend them higher. And those pies I mentioned earlier-only available on special order Add On-had extra time on the way to the airport and had to get in here again. another carrot cake cupcake and a delicious chocolate drizzled coconut macaroon.

Since that visit a month ago we have been there together three times! No judgement. I figure if the world continues on this path, why start working out and a diet now?!

Deux means ""two"" or ""them"" in French causing me to be hopeful that another sister bakery existed in town. Unfortunately this is not the case. However, the owner's daughter does own the popular brunch spot called Scarlett Begonia in town and they serve Deux's pastries. 
Instead, the name Deux Bakery I believe comes from the Fleming parents/couple who own the bakery and have over 40 years of baking experience. 

From a block away on Milpas you can smell the delicious aroma of fresh baked bread and rising yeast. Upon entering, you are immediately greeted by the busy gals in the kitchen. There is a pastry case stuffed with an amazing selection of pastries, along with fresh made loaves of bread on a shelf.

Service - A relaxed atmosphere (maybe too relaxed). The service is admittedly slow and they seem to be understaffed. That being said you're in SB a couple blocks from the beach so it's not too much of a burden to wait a little while.

We have been very strictly quarantining for the past 6 months, but decided to get away to SB for a few days. We were not planning to dine out, but we saw the huge patio at Goat Tree with tables 8+ feet apart and felt comfortable dining there. I'm glad we did!!

All of the staff members were wearing masks the entire time we were there and were very respectful about social distancing. We saw staff disinfecting tables in between customers. We received EXCELLENT service from our server, Linda. She was warm, welcoming and made fantastic suggestions. She anticipated our every need and was very attentive without being overbearing. My husband and I kept commenting how it was the best service we've received in a really long time. I was debating between two items and she made a suggestion to replace the protein on one and it was exactly what I wanted. Thank you, Linda, for making this one of the best meals I've had in a long time...especially during such uncertain times. 

We will definitely return the next time we are in SB!",2020-09-25 03:27:54

First off, let me just say WOW their flavors are so interesting and delightful. I highly recommend pre-ordering (even the night before) to ensure that you'll get your choices. I ordered the Coastal Fog for a friend's birthday, and the Blood Orange Creamsicle + Browned Butter to share. 

They are certainly gourmet donuts (or ""yeast-raised rings"" to be more precise) and are definitely worth the extra price when you take into consideration all of the thought and expertise that goes into crafting each ring. I believe the flavors are often rotated to ensure that there is constant creativity and newness to the variety of flavors - and I really adore that. But I think that there are a few flavors that are consistent and do not switch out - I believe the browned butter is one of them? 

Speaking of the browned butter.... OH MY GOODNESS is the browned butter a delicious donut!! I'm serious - the moment I took a bite into it I melted in love. I know that's sort of dramatic because I'm talking about a donut here, but I'm serious, try one yourself and you'll understand my hype here. Dramatic metaphors aside, the folks at Hook & Press have nailed it - they have done an impeccable job at maintaining a professional, approachable, and super aesthetically pleasing business, and they truly deserve the awards that best represent SB's dining scene. For my specific experience, the Staff was suuper accommodating and friendly, and I could tell how busy they were -  I can only imagine how crazy it can get on a historically busy day (e.g., Valentine's Day), but I can definitely tell that the staff is so friendly and genuine.

Located on state street, this is my favorite donut place in town. They are updating their menus seasonally, or more often. I have tried pretty much every donut so here comes an extensive review. 

Their staples seem to be the cinnamon crumb and the brown butter. If you're looking for something that you're definitely gonna like, these are amazing. The brown butter is a little salty for me, but everyone else I know loves it. Great go-tos.

My favorites that I've ever had are their coastal fog (earl grey flavor) and their everything bagel. The coastal isn't too sweet and you can still taste the tea flavor. Super pretty and delicious. The everything bagel is a SURPRISE. It's salty and sweet, with a cream cheese filling. So yummy, and again, not overwhelmingly sweet. 

We had their chocolate one, I think chocolate 4 ways. That was a little overpowering. Kind of tasted like Krispy Kreme, too sweet and not my fav. Some highlights have been their raspberry, they had either a blueberry or raspberry pancake flavor as well that was delicious. All-in-all, can't go wrong with this place.

But there's a parking lot here for convenience!

Americano had me salivating after my cup like the original location, so that seems to be good.

I've never had avocado toast from anywhere before, so maybe I am just exaggerating, but this was oozing with quality, flavor, and pretty good size too ($10 + $2 for eggs).  Shared the toast and some other pastry with my wife and it was quite filling, great breakfast and coffee to start the day!

Wife did grab us coffee again at the original location before we left SB, will have to ask her if she saw any food there since I prefer to original location's cozyness and coffee for some reason.

Don't let the front facade fool you because these Bakers are doing special things.
I bought :
Glazed Cinnamon Rollls, Honey Buns, PB Cookies and a Dog Biscuit.
One thing that I noticed about the C Buns and Morning Buns is  that they are made with real butter. It's evident upon the first taste of both: the decadent, velvety, unmistakable essence of a real dairy product slightly redolent of grass and cream.
The Cinnamon I think is over glazed almost hiding the well proofed and baked  Cinnamon dough underneath. I did ask for an unglazed one but there were none available.The glaze itself had a sexy hint of orange. Good item! 
The Morning Bun was a bit more problematic. The dough was buttery and assembled with care but it was not dense enough to stay together. This I think is a personal preference. Ok. To be honest I like the Starbucks version better as it is denser and is dippable in a big Cuppa joe. This version fell apart.

Not just lemon

Lovely - lavender lemon doughnut

Not too sour

Happy hour = very yummy,  pure, strong drinks, and very substantial menu choices. 

Bread is made in house and excellent. 

Avocado toast is presenting beautifully  and absolutely delicious... goes far  beyond all the other avocado toasts out there. 

""Goat fries""  are basically really well done French fries with unique  Morocco  seasoning and red pepper dipping sauce.  Elevating! 

Deserts are  divine,   certainly  taste like they are made by a  master  pastry chef. 

Isaiah is  a wonderful waiter who answered  all of our menu questions with gracious care. 

Atmosphere is like a breezy elegant cafeteria with  black and white goat pics.  But it's really lovely to sit  outside.

Stopped by on Sunday around noon and I follow their IG so I saw they were selling a strawberry rhubarb pastry. Unfortunately they sold out by the time I got there but I was still able to get some items

Purchased a blueberry lemon tart which was absolutely delicious - perfect balance of blueberry and lemon with a flaky crust. I also got some rosemary sourdough focaccia which I toasted up the next day - soooo yummy. Last thing I got was the blueberry lemon ricotta (can you tell I like blueberry lemon) but it actually did not taste like blueberry or lemon or ricotta. It did taste DELICIOUS however 

They gave me a bag for the pastry that had ""we loaf you"" on it - absolutely adorable!! The only thing I would change is for them to post prices somewhere because I just ordered not knowing what costs what. Oh well.. it was worth and I hope I can come back!",2021-05-16 21:36:57

I think that they accidentally gave me a regular latte instead of a vanilla latte, since I've gotten the vanilla before at the Canon Perdido location and it didn't have the same vanilla flavor. The croissant was good as always (Renaud's croissants are the best!) and their cherry streusel donut was enjoyable. I'm not sure I would call it a donut because of the denser texture, but I really liked it nonetheless - the slightly tart dried cherries added nice pops of flavor, and I loved the texture of the streusel topping.

I tried a small bite of my friend's brownie, and I loved the rich, decadent peanut butter flavor. It's so nice that they have gluten free options here.

Knocking off a star for the service and for the mixup with my drink, but overall still a good place to go and would be back.",2019-06-02 20:17:03

My absolute favorite item on the menu is their avocado toast- it's a MUST try. It's homemade bread with a generous helping of avocado and toppings such as radishes, tomatoes, and pomegranate seeds. I'd recommend it to anyone going to handlebar for the first time!
As far as their coffee, you can't go wrong with something simple such as an iced latte because their espresso is high quality and super delicious. If you're lactose intolerant like me or just don't drink cows milk, my favorite nondairy option is oat milk. It has a full bodied taste/consistency like whole milk without the dairy! (They use Oatly brand which is my favorite).
In regard to the cafe itself- their is a lot of seating both indoor and outdoor and the inside feels very open and airy. It can get pretty busy on weekends however, so it isn't always super easy to find a seat. The staff is friendly and fast and very good at latte art ;)",2018-09-29 19:48:24

I was inspired by a shirt they sell that says Figueroa, Gibraltar, Refugio. Those are three climbs in Santa Barbara County that are well known by cyclists. When I saw the shirt I had to buy it...but only after doing all three rides. I finally finished the last climb today and went in and bought the shirt. Thanks for the inspiration!

We just went downtown to buy a mirror.  We saw the farmers market and thought, hey, let drop in (our first time there) and pick up dinner...  On our way back from acquiring the mirror, we saw The Book Ends Cafe* sign out on the sidewalk.  Thought, hey, its lunch time, let drop by after the market and try it out... at the market we get this  whole shrimp that was landed at the dock at 5:30 that morning.  Im thinking this day cant get any better.  Back to the Book Ends Cafe we had one of the best sandwiches we've had in an age, Lemony Chickpea on this amazing bread, in fact I could have been eating about anything and it would have been delicious served between that bread!  I asked the owner of the place, where do you get the amazing bread.... ""well, its great little local bakery over on Reddick St., here let me give you the address""...  so off we went... the adventure continues...

Then were driving down this side street thinking ok, where is this place, Deux Bakery.  We pulled up in front, didn't look like much but all I cared about was getting my hands on a loaf of this bread that I had so many plans for already.  To our surprise, not only were you open (but not officially open as later I was inform they are ""closed"" Saturdays, but Wendy, the owner, and Jesse, the baker, where there working away.  Being a newbie to the bread baking world, I had many questions and sort of froze up in front of Jesse.  That was the most fun and so interesting to see the interworking of Deux.  I only wish I had more than one stomach, I wanted to get a loaf of every thing you had and take it home.  

The only down side of finding Deux is now I have very little motivation to bake my own bread now, :-(  :-),  I guess I will figure out something to do with all that free time.   Like cook with that great bread...

I ordered 8 donuts online the night before, and picked them up on Saturday. Online ordering was so easy. The pickup process was very quick, and the girls working there were super sweet. 

My kids were pretty impatient as I opened the box and snapped a pic. My daughter said they were the prettiest donuts she's ever seen. Shortly after she devoured her chocolate four ways donut, she said it was the best donut she has ever had. I whole heartedly agree with her, these donuts are the best. 

We ordered two vanilla bean rainbow sprinkle, two bananas foster, one cinnamon crumb, one browned butter, one Mexican hot cocoa, and one chocolate four ways. Every donut was amazing. I was in awe of the amount of flavor that went into each donut. I could taste the caramelization in the bananas foster. The browned butter was the perfect balance of savory browned butter with a sweet glaze. The hint of spice in the Mexican hot cocoa was such a good surprise. The vanilla bean rainbow sprinkle was so simple but so good. Even the cinnamon crumb was so flavorful and delicious. I truly have nothing negative to say about these donuts.

Side note - We did not feel like crap after eating these donuts. Usually when we eat donuts, I feel like I just ate a big ball of grease. These donuts did not make us feel like that, and yet, they maintained their decadence. You can truly tell the quality of the ingredients in these donuts. Really solid place. I don't think we will ever look at any other donuts the same, because the standard has been set. We will be going back here many many many more times!",2021-03-07 03:35:53

Well, perhaps it's a bit too spacious to fit in in the Bay, which is even better - there's plenty of room in and outside to settle in and enjoy your drink. 
The food offerings were surprisingly varied, and everything behind the counter looked absolutely delicious. My family and I sampled the cheddar and chive scone, donut of the day (blueberry with lemon cream filling), their avocado toast (add egg), and the handlebowl (deceptively tasty). The scone and donut were fun but a little lacking in flavor intensity. The avocado toast is certainly instagram-worthy, and I loved the addition of sprouts and radishes. My favorite, though, was the handlebowl, a vegan bowl of grain and veggies that caught me totally by surprise. It sounded underwhelming to this non-vegan, but now I would eat this every day if I could! 
My drink was a chai latte, and while it wasn't too sweet (my main issue with most chais), the flavor here was also pretty muted. It was tasty but so mild I almost felt like I was drinking spiced milk (not a bad thing, but just not what I was looking for).

There were at least 4 different types of cookies displayed, I  was pleasantly surprised to find out that they take cake orders as well.

The venue is a lot larger than I'd initially envisioned. It's very bright and open, with an expansive patio and lots of floor-to-ceiling windows. The acoustics weren't great inside so it was rather loud, but still quite charming with its modern-meets-Moorish decor. Table service is offered, but I opted to grab a quick bite to-go at the counter. 

The place was bustling with customers and waitstaff alike on this Saturday morning. The pricing was rather high, but I suppose it's normal for the touristy section of Santa Barbara the place is located in. 

I ordered a cold brew coffee and a chocolate ganache croissant. The total topped the $9 mark, meh. The croissant was perfectly buttery and flaky. The creamy chocolate ganache filling reminded me of Jello pudding, but was still a good complement to the savory pastry. The cold brew was strong but flavorful.

This is the one and only handcrafted donut place in the 805 that has established itself in the Mosaic Locale formerly Peet's coffee on State St. 

These donuts are not cheap at $3.25 each but they are definitely worth trying! I paid $18 for half a dozen and shared with my co-workers. We cut them up into sample sized pieces to try all of them. The donuts were a little dense for me and not light and fluffy like regular donuts but more like a bread consistency. I was hoping for a warmer donut and lighter texture but they were still delicious!

My favorites were the PB&J, and pumpkin cheesecake. The POG aka Passionfruit Orange Guava was interesting but I don't think I would order it again because as much as I love guava it was a bit much but that's just my opinion. If you like guava & passionfruit then you will love it! The vanilla bean, and mexican hot chocolate were delicious and flavorful. 

The best part about Hook & Press is the menu changes according to the season so there will always be new flavors to try. This is definitely going to be the latest hot spot so if you plan on checking them out go early since they will sell out fast! They open at 8am.

The roasters are knowledgeable and friendly, providing customers with an unlimited supply of information about the roasting process. The coffee is great. They offer drinks in for-here mugs. Menu options are slim, though they do have baked goods. If you are coming strictly for coffee, Handlebar takes their coffee seriously and you won't be disappointed. Handlebar is situated in a converted industrial warehouse setting, which I love. It has exposed bricks, a large roasting machine, and a long table filled to the brim with locally and other US made treasures, like a glass container of maple syrup and local honey. Yum.

You can preorder (online) one day in advance starting little after 3 p.m.  I came here for the first time last weekend while I was visiting from out of town with my family.  We got here around 10:45 a.m. and they were already completely out of donuts.  Quite ridiculous to see a place run out of its main product in less than 3 hours after opening.  I initially wanted to give this place a bad review, but decided to give it another try.  

For my second visit I ordered in advance, which went smoothly.  I ordered Ube Brownie, Strawberry Basil, Cinnamon Crumb, Browned Butter, Boston Cream Pie, and Lavender Lemonade.  All of them were very good, with the exception of Browned Butter.  It just tasted like sugar glazed donut without any distinct flavor.  Lavender Lemonade was my favorite, even though I generally don't care for lavender flavored items.  Lavender flavor was quite potent, but combining it with lemon balanced it out.  Donuts weren't warm when I got them, but still tasted fresh and clean without any oily aftertaste.  Come to think of it, this place seems very similar to Sidecar Doughnuts in LA/OC area, although I think Sidecar is slightly better.

This place also has some interesting coffee drinks.  PB Latte was quite good, although it didn't have a strong peanut butter taste.  Regular drip coffee was good too.  Wasn't too fond of Lavender Latte because lavender taste was overwhelming.  I guess that's a good thing if you really like lavender.  

Donut flavors change frequently based on seasonal ingredients,  so it's best to check online for current flavors.  It's located inside Mosaic Locale, which is sort of like a tiny food court comprised of three different businesses in one location.  Draughtsmen Aleworks and Buena Onda are the other two businesses.

Because my husband loves donuts (even though I am the opposite about them), I thought I'd surprise him with a detour to this shop as long as we were going to be in the area anyway.  We almost didn't find it because their sign is not out in front on State Street (at least that I could see), and even walking in from the side through a courtyard, we kept walking everywhere but TO that place.  It just wasn't immediately clear, but through a process of elimination, we walked through some glass doors and found them. 

The aroma of freshly baked donuts is sadly not my favorite aroma, but I can appreciate why most of the world can't get enough of it.  It's sweet... but just usually TOO sweet for my nose.  Nevertheless, it didn't bother me here, so I was already happy.  They appear to be a ""small batch"" type place in that they make what they make for the day, and if they run out, so be it.  No more !!  We got there around 2:00 for a 2:30 p.m. closing, so the odds were not in our favor to find all 10 flavors available, and I was right.  Only 5 flavors were left...... and we took the last one on 2 of those flavors.  We tried:

Vanilla Bean Sprinkles
Citrus Blossom Meringue
Cara Cara Creamsicle
Apple Pie
Browned Butter

(The flavors that they were sold out of by the time we arrived were:
Mexican Cocoa, Cinnamon Crumb, Bananas Foster, Burnt Honey & Rosemary, and Boston Cream Pie)  Not sure how often their flavors change, but I wouldn't mind tasting 3 of these at some point.)

As for the flavors we tried, yes, I shockingly took one bite of each.  I have to say, IF EVER I were to become a donut fan (and I'm still not), THIS place would be where I would start.  I say this because they don't appear to be the ""typical"" donut place.  Like not at all.  The donuts are extremely light and airy (yeast kind, no cake... at least when we were there) so they weren't heavy or with that horrible fried dough taste (I hate that), they are also NOT sickeningly sweet, and in fact, for the FIRST time I can comment, there was a hint of salt in each bite, thus balancing out that dreaded sweetness.  It was truly the perfect balance of flavors....... and let me tell you, these were flavor strong.  Not so much just sugar, but the actual flavor..... such as ORANGE, CINNAMON, VANILLA, BROWNED BUTTER.  

As for my husband, he was torn because while he agreed with me on my opinion of the donuts....that these were a higher quality, he admitted to suffering from what the rest of the world loves, thicker, heavier, sweeter donuts.  He'd give this place 4 stars..... but I'm giving it 5 since I wrote the review, and it has a unique appeal for me.  I definitely appreciate what they're about.",2020-02-02 23:04:07

So we had big cups of Joe, a cheddar scone and a cookie called a Hippie cookie.
Am i witnessing a trend, a movement back here in SB to the Hippie Lifestyle? (Noted it in Whole Foods today also) hmmm.
In any event the Coffee today was redolent of dark, stewed cherries and Roasted Pecans as well as perfectly roasted (which is done in house) beans: beans roasted just this side of burnt so as to squeeze out all the flavor the beans posses.

So once upon a time there was this dog named Vito 
And walking with Vito 
on a warm but breezy 
Classic Santa Barbara afternoon 
Was a guy named Chris..

Walking up state street
Having just ran errands 
I was passing by this place 
You all may be familiar with it
""Hook and press doughnuts ""

I walked passed people sitting outside 
Enjoying conversation and a sunny afternoon 
Everything was Perfect 

And passing by perfection 
Well,
How could you not stop by
I thought about it
Wasn't really that hungry 

Curious I was,
What kind of experience would I get going back 
To hook and press for the second time 
Would there be doughnuts Available?

It was after 2pm
They close at 2:30
Standing in front of the doughnut display 
A young lady was ready to help me out
She was smiling and happy 

There were only 3 choices left
Doughnut holes
Strawberry basil
Caramel /passion fruit 

The cashier provided me with a laugh
Doughnut insight ( most popular doughnuts)
And also a favorite pick of hers 
Which happened to be Boston Creme pie 

She also told me
I can stamp her approval 
That the strawberry basil would be a good choice

Ladies and gentlemen 
This doughnut is more than a pastry 
It's a marriage between the odd couple
Dinner (basil) meets dessert (strawberry)

Didn't know what to expect 
My first bite 
Epic, 
like an Indians jones adventure 
Strawberry not overly sweet
Real jam like frosted taste
With hints of tart, soft hints of tart
The basil laid my mind to thoughts of sun setting 
And again I found there dough of the doughnut 
Just like how my mom used to make
The combination of ingredients provided pleasant snacking 

And when it was done
It left my mouth with a great flavor

Doughnuts are notorious for 
Making people feel crappy after you eat them
This one had no ill effects whatsoever 
I'm actually mad I didn't get two

The location is right on State and there should be a couple 75 min free parking lots around the shop. It's a super cute inside area that also serves Captain Fattys beer. The outdoor seating is also cutely decorated and seems like it would be a great place to sit down, work, and watch the hustle & bustle of State St. 

I tried the pecan pie donut and the pumpkin spice latte donut. Pecan pie was the obvious winner, biting into the center filling truly felt like eating some pecan pie! The pumpkin spice latte one was good, but could barely taste the espresso flavor in the cream. Also wish I could taste these fresh out the oven! I went pretty early on and they still weren't. I also tried a lavender latte which was a bit watery, not worth the price tag of $5+.

Overall yes I'd always come back when I have a sweet tooth and craving a nice pecan pie donut ;) oh, they also have THE CUTEST donut shaped dog treats! My pup was elated!",2020-12-18 13:34:38

Oat Bakery is a gem hidden, but very well-known, in DT Santa Barbara. The line is always long but so worth it. My absolute favorites and go-tos are Date Almond Bun, Hygge Bun (ya try to not mess up that pronunciation) , and the super-seed cookie. I'm talking MOUTH WATERING, what dreams are made of good. 

So why 4 stars? On the numerous occasions I have been here - I won't even say how many times to spare me that embarrassment- They are NOT consistent. You'll either get a bun with TONS of almonds, dates or whatever they promise, a BIG cookie , OR you'll be madly disappointed the next week when you pay the same amount for a subpar version of what you waited to eat all week for breakfast. My suggestion is this- look at what is good. If it looks pathetic that day, chances are it tastes as such too. 

I'll be of course returning, hoping for that fully loaded bun, cookie, or bread. However, I wouldn't be surprised if I have to go back and ask for my soggy, undercooked bread to be replaced.",2021-02-27 20:50:29

I haven't been able to visit the location due to Covid but have ordered two 6"" cakes from Sam already. She is responsive, accommodating, and so genuine! She is a pleasure to work with and so talented. 

On both occasions, she accepted my orders on short notice (within days) for two important birthdays and did so without jeopardizing the quality of the cake. The first cake she surprised me with a beautifully decorated salted caramel cake with gold sprinkles all around the outside of the cake. The second time, I had some more specific requests for decoration and she was receptive and honest about her limits and strengths which is SO appreciated. I would much rather hear when someone is uncomfortable fulfilling a request then a generic ""Yes of course"" and later being disappointed. Sam DELIVERED.

We ordered the P.O.G. and Pecan Pie, and we also ordered a matcha tea latte and coffee (hot, straight up). The flavor of the toppings (passion fruit frosting, pecan pie filling, etc.) were awesome!  The coffee was great, and my wife enjoyed the latte but mentioned it could be sweeter.

However, what gives this place a 5-star isn't the food per se, but the approachability and friendliness of the staff.  We were greeted as we entered. Baristas were conversational and helpful.  At the time I was also wearing a t-shirt with the word ""HAWAII"" on the front.  One of the staff members mentioned how he liked.  I learned that he grew up in Maui, and I shared that my grandfather grew up on Kaua'i and how I used to live there.  We ended up talking story for a period of time - about health, the environment, etc.  It was only after the fact that I learned who he was in relation to the store.  I'm finding places like this less and less common - great food and great people.

We came for breakfast because it was included in our stay at the Californian. There was about a 20 minute wait, but it was worth it. I ordered a split of sparkling rosé Moet & Chandon and he ordered a Peroni beer, both refreshing for a warm, beautiful Sunday. 

I was eyeing the Avocado Toast and Smoked Salmon Toast, so I asked if they could just add salmon to the Avocado Toast. Our server knew just what I wanted without needing more explanation. :) It was an extra $10 for the salmon, but the amount was generous. The egg was hard boiled. I would have preferred poached, but the toast was overall hearty and delicious. 

He got the Chicken and Waffles. We both liked how it came with arugula salad to add in a little healthy component to the dish. We also liked the honey with nuts that complemented the maple syrup. The waffle was simple and the chicken was seasoned and lightly fried.

With incredible, fresh-baked loaves and buns, Oat Bakery is making eating bread ""cool"" again. My favorite things to order are the Brie & Cherry Loaf, Spinach & Feta Loaf, Savory Hygge Bun (think Cheesy Monkey Bread with Herbs), Sweet Hygge (think Cinnamon Roll but better, made with dates) and their House Made Granola. I also love their Cashew Truffle Spread (think truffle cream cheese without the cheese.) 

The Gluten Free bread could be employed by the CIA and go under cover as traditional bread without ever breaking cover. It's that good! On one of my visits to the Ty Lounge at the Four Seasons Biltmore Resort, a group of tourists with Celiac Disease ordered their charcuterie board with a side of Gluten Free crostini. After taking their first bite, they flagged the waiter down and proceeded to admonish him for bringing them gluten bread. They were sure it contained gluten because it tasted so good. Nope, it was Oat Bakery's delicious, double-agent, Gluten Free bread. I couldn't resist chiming in and doting about SB's gem of a local bakery and vouching that their crostini was in fact gluten free. They finished their board and bread with delight (and NO anaphylactic shock)!

Many local restaurants and eateries procure their bread from Oat Bakery. Love the Fancy Avocado Toast at Caje? Their Charcoal Sourdough Bread is from Oat Bakery. Crazy about the Raw Cashew Toast at Juice Ranch? - Their bread is from Oat Bakery. Does Healthy Warrior's SuperFood Breakfast Toast make you Happy? - It's also from Oat Bakery! The list goes on and on. Oat Bakery is a hit not to be missed! 

The shop itself is quaint; tucked discreetly between a few other businesses off State Street on Guiterez Street. Blink and you could miss it. This is not a sit down and eat establishment, although their are usually a couple of bar stools inside along bay windows looking out onto Downtown Santa Barbara. Order at the counter and take your goodies to go. It's the perfect stop before a picnic, wine tasting or stroll to the beach. Not to mention before a dinner party.

I paid $7.25 for the two (one cake-style, one filled) and while this is the going rate for a dozen at the typical donut shop, these should not be included within that same echelon. Rather, I'd compare these confections with the artisan pastries you'd find at your local bakery or coffeehouse. 

Both donuts were very good. The browned butter had the perfect sweet/savory combination, and the eggnog creme brûlée was perfectly crisped on the outer shell just like the real deal. The eggnog filling was particularly tasty as well.
