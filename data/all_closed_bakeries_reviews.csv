I loved the hint of the lemon because it wasn't too overwhelming and the maple syrup was really good too! I also ordered the hot chocolate and it was delicious. I am very picky about my hot chocolate and it was just right!

Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential, but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience, they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer.",2014-10-12 19:23:18

I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.

Ioi_RMBvhEAYZg0vjeRwrw,5mo4zCTWU_MQf1tdGAoV4g,O6RCCmz8-x4NhWJpI8KQug,4,0,0,0,"I admire Breakfast for opening their space to all-ages shows, regularly featuring artists' photos, paintings, even sculptures, and hosting casual food pop ups. 

I know many reviewers have said the left side of the shop is gimmicky and ""too hip"" (branded merch, surf/skate mags, and comfy chairs), but the last time I was here kids were loving the connect four out on the table-- what's to hate about that? 

That said, their espresso can be hit or miss, and sometimes my Gibraltar milk is a little too hot and a little too fluffy, but they use good beans and their drip brew is great. Yes, their staff can be intimidatingly terse, but regulated cheeriness (that's the norm at shops that rhyme with CandleJar) doesn't have a place here. I like that. 

Where else in Santa Barbara can you sit on a sofa and drink a cuppa? Find an outlet next to your table? Simple problems; Breakfast is a simple answer.",2018-09-03 18:35:48

First of all, they put amazing samples of breads with olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar.  I could craze along the counter all day, and be a very happy man.  I have to say that their olive bread is to die for.  After loading up on the carbs, you are ready for something refreshing.  The salads are beyond exceptional.  The ingredients are dripping with freshness, and feels like farm to table while you wait.  If you are looking for a sandwich, the Cubano is just the ticket.  The first time I went in, I asked the cashier what she recommended because I was having a hard time deciding.  She told me that her favorite, without a doubt, was the Cubano.  So, I gave it a shot.  Now, I need my fix at least once a week.  I think there is an addictive agent in that sandwich.  It's probably in the bread - ya know, the bread that they have calling and enticing you from the top of the display case like a seductress.  Oh, did I fail to mention that once they get you in their grip, you're soon turned onto the pastries and goodies in the display case???  They have so many to choose from, and each one looks delectable.  They even have vegan and gluten free, which I was skeptical about, but very happily surprised.  I would be totally neglectful if I didn't mention the AWESOME staff.  They are genuine, fun, and really ensure that you have a positive experience.  No matter what mood you walk into Our Daily Bread in, you leave in a great mood.

Breakfast Culture Club serves my favorite espresso in Santa Barbara. In fact, it's some of the best espresso I've ever had (better than even the best I've found in LA/SF). It has a fruited sweetness to it, a hint of red fruit, perfect mouthfeel, and insane sweetness. Their beans are from Coava, which I'd never had until coming here, and the espresso blend is just brilliant. I think they used to use coffee from Handlebar, which also makes good espresso, but I'm very glad they switched because Coava makes a much more interesting espresso (Handlebar is good, but very typical--roasty toasty notes, caramelly, but definitely not fruity).

I like to get a Gibraltar, a Cappuccino, or just straight espresso. The Gibraltar and Cappuccino both bring out the strawberry notes of the espresso, and end up very sweet because the espresso is just great here. The texture they achieve on their milk is fantastic as well--exactly what I want in a Cappuccino. That said, if I want something with more punch I just go straight for the espresso.

Their toasts are also very good. I think they've changed how they do toasts since previous reviewers posted--they prepare the toast for you, so it actually is instagram ready if you're into that :)

As for ambiance, this place is perfect. The opened garage door makes the whole place feel very open and spacious. Strong hipster and surfer vibes around, you'll often see people barefoot. Also usually a couple people working on their laptops. There's about 4 or 5 power outlets available. Usually I've been able to get a spot with an outlet if I need it, but in the morning it can be so busy that it's hard to find a free table with an outlet.

Highly recommend stopping in here if you like fruitier espresso drinks.",2018-08-16 07:03:58

I had just been in San Francisco and had crazy good toast at The Mill. There's really no one doing toast in So Cal except for here. Huge thick pieces of toast served with fresh ground peanut butter and homemade strawberry preserves. Seriously - this whopping piece of toast was enough for 2 people. 

I know they supply a number of local restaurants with their bread but it's great to stop in here and pick up a loaf for yourself at home. In the mornings, they often have a selection of their fresh loaves cut up for you to sample. Fantastic!!",2015-06-12 03:18:59

I was up in Santa Barbara the other day and we noticed this Cafe as we drove around.

The next day when we wanted to go out for breakfast I went to YELP to read the reviews.

Its rating was good enough for us to go try it and we are so happy we did.
Though I will say this place is better then its  current rating of 3.5 stars.

We almost turned around  and left when we first got there because the menu posted on the front door said that breakfast was only served until 11 AM and it was 11:10 when we got there.   Fortunately I walked inside and asked the gentlemen behind the counter if we could still get breakfast.  He informed me that  BREAKFAST IS SERVED ALL DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Those are my five favorite words in the world at a Restaurant as breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.

I ordered a 3 egg omelette with the breakfast potatoes and sourdough toast. 
My friend had the Breakfast Burrito.  They were both FABULOUS!  The omelette was light and fluffy.  They do not chince on the ingrediants I had plenty of tomatos in my omelette.  The breakfast potatoes were delish.  

We ordered a cup of  coffee and that was also outstanding.  They give you a cup and its self serve.  I love that.  They have plenty of options for things you can add to your coffee such as Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Chocolate powder.  You can also order Espressos and other coffees that they prepare for you.

Even though we were stuffed we decided to try something for dessert.  We went with the Cinnamon Roll with Pecans  (I think they call it a Schneiken?).  It was so good.

We left there full and content.

It was a no brainer where we were going to breakfast today- right back to Our Daily Bread.

The ciabatta bread is to die for, I had that with my omelette today. Their Rye bread is also top notch.

The employees are warm and friendly.  Really a nice crew.

The prices are a bit high, but its Santa Barbara so its to be expected. Breakfast for two was just under $30.00 the first day and $28 the second day.  That was without the extra treats we bought after breakfast.  I adore carrot cake, but would not recommend the one they sell here.  The texture of the cake was odd- it was actually ""squishy"" and wet when you bit into it. 

I understand they are very busy on the weekends but since we will be up there one more day, we might just brave the crowds so we can have one more fix of this terrific place.",2014-05-10 01:21:02

Then after waiting in line for a while it occurred to me that maybe the line was due to the comically slow service.  I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.

Finally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.  The coffee was a perfect complement to the wonderfully sour toast.

Rolled up two car garage with just open air seating. Very clean, white, and minimalist. There are more than enough tables and chairs for studying, working, or chatting. To the left is where they display all their merch, couch with board games. 

I know the name screams BREAKFAST, but this is not really a breakfast joint. It's more of a coffee / tea / pastry place. They have a small menu for drinks and a small pastry case. I'm not a coffee person, but I tried their Matcha latte with almond milk and that was flavorful! Their chocolate chip cookie is delish. Such a hip and clean space.

We ordered and sat outside, and even the manager walked by without thinking to clean our dirty table, until we asked him over to do so (and to clean the one next to us so we didn't have to look at it too).

We ordered Spinach Eggs Benedict, yet were told that they were out of spinach.  They offered to substitute zucchini, which we accepted - yet had to look hard for when it came.  The hollandaise was more like a mayonnaise without any true flavor.  And while it was good that they didn't overcook the egg so the yolk would still be runny - they way undercooked it, with parts of the white still uncooked.  Yuck.

We were thinking to point that out to them, but there was a definite sense that no one who worked there would have even cared enough.

We also ordered huevos rancheros which was quite under-seasoned and bland. 

We bought a loaf of gluten-free bread to take home, and were seriously unimpressed - threw it away after eating less than half.

They serve Handlebar coffee and have many milk options, including my favorite almond milk. Also, on Sundays they have breakfast burritos! They have a vegan and non-vegan option.

Here I am on a Saturday, looking for God in all the wrong places.  All I had were the gluten free chocolate chip cookie and the Rose matcha green tea, and well...My thoughts?

1.) I like the pools of chocolate in the cookie, but I wish it were chewier.  Gluten free anything always feels like it's missing something...

(gluten? Lol)

Gluten is the glue that holds everything together, and without it, everything falls apart.  I mean this on a spiritual level.

2.)  And the rose matcha fell flat somewhere.  It was neither pronounced in rose or matcha flavor.  You need to pick a side.  You need to make a choice.  You need to commit.  You need to be STRONG with one flavor and have a HINT of the other, but you kinda did neither.   You were half-assed polyamorous.  You didn't pick a winner and run with it.

The space is part of a modern strip mall shared with Kanaloa Seafood and an office space.  I liked that they offered soy, almond and oat milk which is nice addition, but their coffee was simply mediocre for a Seattle coffee snob like myself. Based on my first-hand visit, they focus mostly on being a ""culture club"" by combining a communal space, coffee drinks and artist culture. As their website states: ""Founded on the principle of connecting artists around the world, Breakfast is by and for a group of friends who like to make things and go places."" Their walls are covered by fun local art; there's even a map of the art, its artist bio and price.

Even following them from their move to this location our family has been buying bread and pastry from Our Daily Bread for many years. 

Not any more!  

Over the past few weeks, the quality of their products has declined dramatically.  The cases are clearly filled with at least day-old products - choose carefully and look for volume so you can be assured that the breads/pastries were baked recently.  We have found that there are only a few types of bread/pastries in any quantity on the shelves - and if there are only a few left, they are clearly older than a day or two.   Their bread stales quickly so beware.  Shouldn't bakeries clearly label and at least discount day+ old products?

Last week we purchased a few croissant, pastries, breads for a party. The croissants were deformed, oily (where's the butter?), dense, tough and heavy - the baker clearly has no concept of what a real one even looks like, let alone tastes.   Ditto the pastries - Costco does it better!  After a bite or two, we tossed all of them.

But my latte didn't taste like it was professionally pulled and the milk was not steamed in that creamy way that other craft shops do it (Handlebar, etc). It was like getting a decent latte at Nordstrom. 

The toasts that sounded so great on the menu were a real loser. Instead of serving you something amazing, well slathered with butter and jam or cinnamon and sugar, they present you with a barely toasted slice of bread topped with plastic to-go containers of butter, jam, etc. it is a laughable presentation and certainly not Instagram ready if you're into that. Trying to make your own toast with barely toasted bread and way too small, plastic containers of butter and jam is a big drag and the taste is even worse.

Toast is a huge deal in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Apparently it hasn't quite caught on here yet. At least they don't know how to do it.

Easy, lounge-y seating with surf art and books everywhere; yes, very cool. But, in an un-ironic, ""joke's on them"" kind of way, their breakfast offerings are hardly worthy of the name of this place. I literally have more choice of breakfast food at Spudnuts donuts down the street.

This morning, I ordered a ham/swiss croissant and a small coffee. I guess the croissant was within arm's reach, so that was served up quickly and without issue. But the worker moved away to resume her conversation with another worker in hushed tones despite my looking around a bit confused for my coffee. A third worker came up and asked if I needed something and I said I think I need my small coffee. I then got my small coffee. Luckily, none of that interrupted the two other workers 3 feet away.

Terrible.

The coffee here is decent, a fancy roaster in town called handlebar. It's good, but really expensive. Coffee prices here are steep, be ready to shell out 3 dollars or so for drip coffee. The same goes for the selection of foods. Even though this place is decent, it's overrated.

The coffee shop part has steel chairs on a concrete floor. In my opinion it's neither a place to grab a quick coffee and bite (prices) or stay and hang out because it's not cozy and with the concrete floors gets incredibly loud.

My donut was 4.50 and there were only 3 on display and the stingy in me didn't even care. They were hyped up donuts if anything. And if all the pastries are vegan, they might be vegan too. There was a donut that resembled a Somoa Girl Scout cookie, one with an orange glaze and literally a snicker doodle in the hole, and an orange marmalade donut, so there's an idea of what you're paying for. 

I picked the orange marmalade and it was reeeeally dense. I had to go home and eat that fool with a fork and a steak knife. Regardless, the denseness and size became my lunch and it was delicious. So yeah that was a 4.50 orange marmalade donut sandwich reminiscent of Donut Friend in LA. Cold brew was delicious and tasted like good cold brew.

For starters ""the breakfast culture club"" has no real breakfast options. There are a couple delectable treats in their display case but nothing you could call a substantial or even healthy breakfast meal choice. 

The coffee was definitely fresh and did hit the spot but not my favorite by any means and really just an average Cup o Joe.

If you work in the area, like I do, you'll be thrilled to have a locally owned and operated business in your neck of the woods instead of hitting one of the commercial coffee mega giants. 

Breakfast Culture Club serves up delicious brew from Handlebar Roasting Company and yummy pastries from Flag Stone Pastries, including a vast selection of vegan treats. 

The layout is expansive with seating inside at multiple tables, outside on their patio overlooking Chapala St and a living room like area with a sofa and coffee table. 

The staff are warm and friendly. If you frequent French Press or Handlebar, you'll probably even recognize a few of their smiling faces. 

I love the art on the wall from Xst! Super cool portraits taken mostly with an iPhone. I could definitely see myself hanging art like this on my wall at home. 

They have plenty of merchandise for sale if that tickles your fancy, too! This looks like a great place to work remotely, study, read, chat with friends and/or just chill and people watch. 

There is a small parking lot in front of the shop or plenty of 75 minute street parking on the roads nearby. I'm so glad this is so close and look forward to getting my coffee fix regularly! On that note, I tend to be more of tea or matcha drinker these days and I did not pay attention to see if they carry either of those. If not, bring matcha please!",2016-05-23 20:36:03

2 months before the wedding we met her at her studio to have a cake tasting. For $25, we could taste 6-7 slices of all different sorts of cake flavors, icings and fillings. We ended up choosing a 2 layer cake with the first layer being a chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and fresh raspberries, and the second layer a white cake with a cream and lemon filling. For the icing we picked a white fondant that was decorated in a traditional pattern. We choose to decorate the cake with fresh flowers that matched my wife's bouquet, which Christine was able to do herself on the day of our wedding at no extra cost!

As for the day of, Christine was able to deliver our cake to Bouchon before dinner, as well as display/decorate the cake herself. When we arrived to the restaurant from the wedding ceremony, it was beautifully presented off to the side of the room!

As for the cake itself, it was exceptionally delicious and fresh, and we had real trouble trying to pick which flavor of cake we enjoyed more! Having been on a wedding diet for a while, it was a real treat to indulge in both an aesthetically beautiful and exquisitely tasteful cake!

No joke.

Christine Dahl seems to prefer phone contact over e-mail- I have phone shyness so I was a little nervous at first but it ended up being fine and more direct and she actually picked up whenever I called.

I told Christine I wanted to have some succulents decorating the cake and she said she was familiar with the florist I was using (grassroots) so I told the florist as well and they took care of it - I never had to deal with it. All I know is, when I showed up at my wedding, a beautiful cake was there and was decorated with succulents that matched my wedding flowers.

Her prices are very reasonable considering the excellent quality and it was easy to work with her within our specified budget and approximate number of guests. She's a real pro. Besides being an excellent baker, it's clear she has a lot of experience and runs her business professionally. I would recommend you go straight to her for your wedding cake!",2014-07-03 18:04:43

Okay, not good, delicious cake, as in, I haven't had a yellow cake/chocolate buttercream frosting this good since never. It's that good. I love the texture of this cake. Is it pudding mix? Is it a pinch of cornmeal?  Something denses it up in just the right, satisfying bite kind of way. I'm parsing it out, one slice at a time.

We emailed back and forth to decide on what cupcakes my fiancé and I were interested in trying. We then set a date and time where we were able to meet Carole. Upon arriving Carole was very warm and handed us a box of 4 cupcakes in adorable packaging. She let us take the cupcakes with us so we could try them on our own and decide what we liked best. After leaving Carole we dug in and every cupcake was delicious! We ended up choosing the salted caramel vanilla and tiramisu cupcakes, as well as a 5in cutting cake. Carole worked with our wedding schedule and set up the cupcake table, using her stand which we rented, and made sure that everything was perfect. All of our guests expressed how the cupcakes were the best they had ever had. Both were moist, perfectly iced and visually appealing.

To start with, I do not live in Santa Barbara, but in the San Francisco bay area, yet I needed to locate a local-to-Santa-Barbara baker to bake a cake for my mother's 80th (!) birthday party.  And not just any cake - this was an effort to re-create, or at least approximate, a cake she used to buy at a bakery in Dallas, TX, back in the 60's.  (no pressure there, eh?)

Thank you, yelp*, for helping me to find Delicious Expressions and Carole.  I called her and discussed what I wanted - just one week in advance of the party.  Then I checked with my mother about party plans.  Tweaking was necessary - the date of the party, and certain details about the cake needed to be changed.

I finally placed my order for the cake just 4 days before the party:
a two-layer lemon cake with lemon curd filling, topped with lemon curd, with lemon buttercream frosting on the sides, and with unsweetened shredded coconut on top (tastes good, and helps pretty-up the lemon curd).

Carole promised that the cake would serve 8-12 people.  Her charge for the cake was very reasonable, AND that included the delivery!

Here's the best part:  a couple of days after I ordered the cake, I suddenly remembered that although the yelp reviews I had read had all been very positive, few of them had mentioned the cake itself - the flavor, texture, taste, etc.  - and I am one particular gal when it comes to cake.  I re-read the reviews and found one that mentioned how delicious the cake was - although it did not go into the sort of detail I was looking for.  So I admit I was a little worried...

I am happy to provide a report now:  This cake was OUTSTANDINGLY delicious!!  The cake was light - yet not so light as to resemble something out of a cake-mix box.  It was moist, yet not oily.  For my taste, a perfect cake - soft and cakey and just-moist-enough.  The lemon buttercream frosting that decorated the side of the cake was really delicious - everything one hopes a good buttercream will be - smooth and moist and rich and flavorful, like a dense, lemony whipped cream.  (And I am not really a huge frosting fan, so it has to be just right for me to want to eat it all.)

When I placed the order with Carole, she was a little surprised (and, I think, a bit concerned) about all that lemon.  I explained to her that we are people who love lemon, and she agreed to make it as I requested.  When she delivered the cake, she told me that since I said we liked lemon so much, she had even added some lemon to it!  Well, it was PERFECT!!!!  And I was, and am, THRILLED with every aspect of the finished product.

One final note:  We had 10 people for dinner, and the layer cake was ample for our purposes.  When dinner was over, we had consumed about 2/3 of the cake; later that evening, there was less, because I had to have seconds.  Carole told me it would serve 8-12; well, those 8 portions would have been HUGE.

Oh, and yes - my mom loved it!!  Thank you, Carole, for putting the perfect finishing touch on my mother's 80th birthday party!!!

In sum - DELICIOUS Expressions is a wonderfully apt name for this baking enterprise.  You can trust everything everyone else has posted here on yelp about this local business, and you can now know that in addition to the quick service, and all the things other yelpers have posted, that Carole bakes a delicious cake!",2011-12-21 00:36:27

First and foremost, all I have to say is... Salted. Caramel. Vanilla. Cake.  Again... Salted caramel vanilla cake.  It was one of the most amazing things I've ever tasted in my life.  But... rewind a bit.  At first, I asked to have the cake delivered (which, in and of itself, is amazing.  It's SO hard to find a bakery, let alone a GREAT bakery, that will deliver) to the place I chose to have dinner at that night... but then I found out that the dinner spot didn't open until 5PM... which was later than when Delicious Expressions stopped delivering.  They had no problem switching the delivery spot at the last minute to a winery where a group of friends and I were having a wine tasting earlier in the afternoon.  

I'm not sure what else to say, except that the cake was magnificent, their service was impeccable, and their cakes... even with as astounding as they are... are totally reasonably priced.  The cake was a hit with everyone that tried it, and I can't recommend this place enough.

After trying wedding cakes at five Santa Barbara/Montecito bakeries, I almost gave up. Her location is difficult to find, but once you do, you will not regret it!

Ms. Dahl was very patient as we looked through hundreds of pictures of wedding cake designs and sampled four of her cakes. She has a book filled to the brim with photographs of her gorgeous creations. Ms. Dahl was very concerned that I got the exact design and colors I wanted to match my wedding.

I ended up choosing a 3 tier cake with 2 tiers made of her absolutely delicious vanilla cake with passionfruit and coconut filling. The one tier made of her decadent chocolate cake was also scrumptious. However, I highly recommend the passionfruit/coconut - my wedding guests are still raving about it!

The best part about my wedding cake from Christine Dahl Pastries was the taste. I think that a Duncan Hines cake that came from a box tastes better than most wedding cakes. Ms. Dahl's creation was easily the best cake I have ever had. It didn't taste bland and my guests actually ate it!

I highly recommend using Christine Dahl Pastries for a wedding cake.",2012-07-10 22:46:18

Even the fondant was more than edible, it was actually tasty, which is usually not the case.  The price was not bad ... I think $250 for a three tier cake for 50 people.  The top and bottom layers were chocolate with chocolate filling and a chocolate hazelnut ganache.  The middle layer was a white cake with lemon filling and a fresh berry layer.  She was great when we did the tasting, and worked with us to make a beautiful cake.  My only minor qualm with the wedding cake was that we had asked her if the cake layers could be slightly thicker and the filling slightly thinner, as I thought it was a bit much, she said sure, but it didn't really happen.  We just went back to her for our anniversary and she made us a small cake, which again was delicious (the same chocolate hazelnut filling).  On the anniversary cake, when we picked it up, it wasn't decorated the same, and she said that was because she didn't have a picture of our cake (bummed she didn't call or email us - we have plenty of pics of it).  Also, when we got our wedding cake, she told us the price for the anniversary cake was $25, but when the time came, she said it would be $40.  I would totally go to her again for a special occasion cake, as the cake was amazing, I would just be a little more clear on the details with her.",2014-07-27 05:39:20

She created the cake for our wedding in July 2015 and with the busyness of newlywed life, I am just getting around the writing this! We paid $240 for a cake that fed 50 people. It was two tiered (picture uploaded as well) with a gorgeous slate blue that Christine matched to a fabric swatch I brought of my bridesmaids dresses. She matched the color absolutely perfect. Also, the main reason I booked with Christine was that she has the skill set to execute a technique with gold painting. Basically its an edible gold that is painted onto fondant. Anyway, most bakeries in Santa Barbara either could not do it or charged ridiculous prices for cakes with these style on them. 

Christine is an excellent baker. This became extremely apparent at our cake tasting where we sampled between 8 and 10 samples of different cake flavors and different fillings.

On weekends only a more expensive ""brunch"" menu is available. The food is standard, but not noteworthy.

Since it's downtown and beat they parking structure, you can enjoy a nice stroll before/after Jeannine's.

Brunch menu offers a good variety from pancakes to egg Benedict to French toast to omelettes. 
I like how there's variety and creativity in the menu options.

For ex: Lobster omelette, Kahlua French toast, crabs egg Benedict, etc.

The food came out super fast!!! And you must ORDER FIRST. When you walk in, get a take number, then order, and you tell the cashier your table number so that the waiter will bring out your food at your table...

I had their egg white scramble with asparagus, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and a side of biscuit. 
My only complaint is the biscuit. I know it's just a biscuit and it comes with pretty much most of the entrees... But the biscuit could be made a little better. I didn't like it at all. It was sort of bland, hard, and no fluff to it. :(

My friends shared a breakfast burrito and that was pretty large. Def fun to share bc it's a lot.

I also tasted their smoothies...mango, pineapple, banana.  It's okay I think they could do a better job with the balance of each fruit. It was a little too sour.

I had a Cuban cappuccino, while my wife had a standard one.  The frothed sweetened condensed milk was really good in the Cuban.

She ordered an omelet with goat cheese while I had French Toast with caramelized bananas.  Talk about dessert for breakfast.  We shared both, which is good since the French Toast plate would have been more calories than I like to eat in a weekend.  The omelet was also really good, surprisingly good for something that is really a simple dish.  I think that cooking the veggies just right really makes a difference, the filling was not some soggy goo of veggies.

As they say, pictures can be deceiving but you can't taste the deliciousness of flavoring through a picture. If you could, I would have been a photographer! I want Apple to design a scratch 'n sniff/taste application! :)

Anyways, the host (I think her name was Sara) was real nice - super friendly and talked to us for a few minutes about their food. The food is a must-have as that one girl from The Real World would always say, ""point blank period!"" That is how I feel about this place. The best banana kahlua french toast I've ever had point blank period!!!

It brought me back to another place in Boston which had the best pancakes in the world. Well, this awesome place has the best, absolutely the best banana kahlua french toast in the world!!!

Their sweet potato fries were great too! They added black pepper to it which gave it some extra deliciousness. The sauce was regular though and I should suggest using a chipotle type of sauce since the two go together like my mouth-savory taste buds go together with Jeannine's.

Yes, it's that good that it'll make you tongue-tied and full of non-sense but at least you're full of awesomeness!!!

Unfortunately, the last three times I've gone there, the service has been TERRIBLE. For such a classy restaurant with high-end prices, I expect to at least get decent customer service, but sadly this hasn't been the case. Just two days ago, I went in for a late lunch and the woman I ordered from was completely unfriendly, had an annoyed smirk on her face, and when I thanked her she just ignored me and walked away. She told me she'd bring me the coffee I ordered and for the THIRD TIME I had to ask another waiter to get my cup of coffee after all the food had been brought out. A good breakfast restaurant should know that coffee should be brought to the customer before they're food is brought out 15 or so minutes later after ordering. I was never checked on once after my food and then coffee was delivered to me, and this had been the case my other recent visits to the restaurant. You just walk in, order your food, they deliver it to you, and then your ignored for the remained of your breakfast/lunch. They also used to have the waiters bring you water in glass jars, but now you have to get your own water out of tiny plastic cups... again very tacky and a hassle for such a restaurant. I have received much better service from far less expensive restaurants.

There have been times when their baked goods and desserts were scrumptious while other times, they were just bad and dry with no taste at all. My most recent visit, I had ordered a chocolate cookie that tasted like uncooked dough and I couldn't really taste any chocolate in it. I also ordered smoked salmon plate with bagels and it was very ordinary. The smoked salmon wasn't fresh and bagels were very dry and stale. Even the chicken pesto sandwich was just decent and nothing special. 

Lately, service has been subpar. There were times when I would get a very nice staff worker when I ordered my food. But recently, I would get some that weren't very courteous and unfriendly or even crack a smile.

I'm moving from the Santa Barbara area, so I'm trying to hit all of the ""hot spots,"" as defined by friends and yelp, so Jeannine's was definitely on my list for a brunch stop.

We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday.  Me and the bf just had to wait about ten minutes for a table.  The waiting/ordering/number process is a bit confusing.  We decided on the wild salmon hash and omelet with goat cheese, asparagus tips, and corn.  I ordered a coffee and the bf ordered a latte.  I received a half-full small mug of coffee.  It was very strange.  There were free refills of course, but why didn't I get a full mug to begin with?  The coffee and latte were quality.

We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food, it seemed a bit long.  The food overall was just okay.  It was way under seasoned and under salted.  Even after adding several shakes from the salt shaker, the food was lacking.  The salmon hash was more ""wet"" than expected.  Not in a completely bad way, but I'm used to crunchy, crispy, salty corned beef hash, which was an opposite texture of the salmon hash.  The omelet was just okay.  I recommend Esau's cafe for the best omelet I've had so far in Santa Barbara (or almost best ever at any restaurant).

But, because service and courtesy lacks..... it's really 1 1/2 stars.

We arrived at 7:30am on a Thursday so, there were plenty of tables available.
The cashier seemed to notice we were looking for menus.
Never said a word. I found them tucked away next to the side of the register. So, we were talking over our ordered and she kindly informed us that we could sit down and decide then come back up to order.
 I'm an adult, young lady. I know exactly when I'd like to sit and when it's unnecessary.
So, an elderly couple walked up next to us and heard what she was saying to us.
Then inquired if they now take orders at the tables.
 I wanted to say no, they don't. She just wants to push people around when theres no reason too. There's not that many people here, no reason to rush folks. But, I didn't say a word. I just ignored her.
Then, I'm ordering...of course, i have to order things in her order. I can't just say pancake breakfast with scramble eggs and sausage. Nooooo.... she has to back me up. Start over....first which pancake breakfast... i said there's only one listed. I said buttermilk right as shes schooling me.... do you want multigrain or buttermilk. What kind of eggs...im saying scrambled shes still talking.... I'm saying sausage she listing what meats that are available. (Now who's rushing who?) Irritating!!
She makes me repeat everything as if she didn't hear any thing i said.
Then same thing goes for my biscuits and gravy order.
I order the $12 biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy.... do you want to add eggs for an additional cost?  I just said eggs over easy...ah, wait what? What extra charge? She says eggs are additional $2.
 It clearly states eggs on the friggin menu. I grab the menu and show her $12 biscuits and gravy with eggs. No mention of just biscuits and gravy on menu for $10.
 She just stays in her world and continues to ask if i'm ordering just biscuits and gravy because they offer that too. 
I informed her that I clearly stated I wanted eggs over easy. 
She is clearly too comfortable in her position. 
Anyways, enough of that.
The coffee was terribly strong and just plain terrible. I was shocked because they offer Peets as well but I don't believe it was Peets. It didn't taste like it.
The hubby liked his meal. Perfectly scrambled eggs, good sausage, and large pancakes topped with strawberries and blueberries. He enjoyed all of it.
I ordered a side of potatoes which is a mixture of several types of potatoes. It would've been better if the large thin sliced russets were cooked through. 
The biscuits and gravy were good. Lots of sausage but needed more gravy. Eggs cooked perfectly.  All in all it was good.

You are prompted to wait in line to order, and after you order you're ushered to your table. It's not cheap, but you pay for the environment and pretty good customer service. We were greeted warmly and given water, our food came out in very reasonable times, and even sitting outside, everything was pretty clean.

My friends and I stuck to some safe choices and went for the Norwegian Benedict and the Dungeness Crab Omelet. If you can afford to splurge a bit, I'd recommend the Dungeness Crab Omelet. The omelet was pretty fluffy, and inside the omelet was a load of shredded crab meat. The meat tasted pretty fresh and was ""seafood-y"" in the best way possible (aka not fishy). The Norwegian Benedict was also pretty good, if not particularly exciting. At least all three orders of the Benedict came with perfectly done eggs. You can't say that at every brunch place, unfortunately...

Overall, there are definitely some cheaper options, but Jeannine's is one of the better brunch places I've been to in Santa Barbara. Not to mention, their bakery goods looked so tempting! Would recommend.",2017-06-10 23:47:19

I am vegetarian and had ordered the farmers omelette; 4 bites into the omelette I noticed two pretty big pieces of bacon inside. I spoke to the hostess (because the waiters kept ignoring me) and told her what had happened. She did not even apologize once! Infact she proceeded to ask if I would like it re-made which I'm not sure why it was a question that even needed to be asked. Isn't it obvious that I want to eat a meal that I paid for? I gave them a chance and waited 25 more minutes for my food to be remade and it still wasn't ready. No manager came to apologize, and no one offered to comp my meal. I had to leave because I was with a group of people who were done and were just waiting for me so I walked over to the hostess again and told her I didn't want the food anymore. Again, she said nothing but a ""are you sure? We can give it to you in a to go box""; I was so shocked again at their lax reaction! I had to specifically ask them to refund my meal because they did not even have the courtesy to say that themselves! I have never eaten bacon in my life and I was horrified to see that in my food - apparently it is not a big deal for Jeannines here and they clearly don't know what customer service means!

I ordered the pancake breakfast with a vanilla latte and my boyfriend got the breakfast burrito (which he found was great!). We found a table and sat for about 2 minutes when the gentleman that took our order told me that they couldn't make pancakes (that was the only reason we went there). I wanted to eat a sweet breakfast so I decided to sub with the french toast. Also a no-go. 

Disappointed, I just decided to go with the chicken pesto sandwich. I decided to not get grumpy over their lack of pancakes and french toast (you would think they would some bread and eggs for this?) but it was odd when one of the managers or supervisors yelled at me from across the room that my latte was on its way. 
Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was delicious and their lattes never disappoint. But the main reason I wanted to go was for their pancakes. I guess we shouldn't go on Thursdays anymore as they run out of the sweet stuff!

The restaurant has cute outside seating, and diner-like decor inside. It's all self-seating, and some tables are a little cramped, so be prepared to wait on weekends.

- Coffee, etc: hot drinks, lattes, et al are great and large here! Cute designs in the foam too.
- Breakfast Quesadilla: definitely lacking some pizzazz! I'd say PASS
- California omelette: Good, but not great. Again, missing some pizzazz.
- Breakfast club: Good standard breakfast with the works.
- Low carb: the heavy cream makes this not as much a healthy choice, but it was still very tasty.
- Kahlua French toast: very sweet syrup and served with minimal bananas. They also have no peanut butter here, so bring your own if you want some extra spread!

This place is more a pastry and coffee shop; the cookies, muffins and cakes look delicious!! The Kahlua french toast will satisfy your sweet tooth and the omelettes will fill your belly. The service is just so-so, we had to ask multiple times for napkins, utensils, sides, etc. The coffee is great, probably because they use Peet's, and the juice tastes fresh squeezed. From what we tried, the food is good, just not great. All of the omelettes come with the bare minimum, and it seems like they skimp on the veggies and add-ons. Still, if you like French Toast, I'd say give it a try. If you're more of a traditional breakfast goer, then perhaps another place with a more attentive staff and fully loaded plates.

If you are dining with a large group, it's better to order and pay at the counter and not fuss about splitting the bill afterwards.  However, if that's not an issue, then sit and a waitress/waiter will take your order.

Breakfast Club
American Pancake Breakfast with French Toast
Eggs Benedict
Lobster Benedict
Veggie Benedict
Ricotta Poppy Seed Pancakes
Norwegian Benedict
Smoked Salmon Scramble

Everyone seemed to really like what they ordered.  I got the American Pancake Breakfast with French Toast.  The bacon was thick, full of flavor, and chewy, not crispy.  I enjoyed the challah bread french toast.  This may have been my first time trying this bread, but it was tasty with a drizzle of syrup.

I had a bite of the Ricotta Poppy Seed Pancakes--they were delicious.  There's a hint of lemon flavor in the pancakes, but not so much that it made your lips pucker after tasting something really sour.

For those who ordered lattes, the baristas added cute designs in the foam.  We found parking easily on Anacapa, make sure to pay attention to the signs.",2013-11-26 21:56:02

Order your food at the counter and then seat yourself inside or at their outdoor patio. 

Food: The restaurant serves benedicts, french toasts, oats grains and cereals, breakfast burritos/sandwich/quesadilla/plates, omelets,  salads and club/turkey berry/chicken pesto sandwiches. Since the dishes were a bit pricey and we wanted to leave our stomach for other restaurants, my friends and I shared a Norwegian Benedict ($16) and the Banana Kahlua French Toast ($13.50). The Norwegian Benedict had smoked salmon, two poached eggs, cucumbers\, tomato, onions, capers, cream cheese, dill and home-made hollandaise a side of fruits. The Banana Kahlua French Toast had Challah bread, dipped in spiced egg mix, kahlua-glazed bananas and powered sugar.  Both of the dishes were amazing!! Everything tasted so good and fresh. 

The staff was very friendly and I love the setup and decor of the place. However, they had TVs on the wall which kind of threw me off since I wasn't expecting TVs at a place like this.

We arrived at 6:40 and settled ourselves by a window alongside other early bird patrons and patiently waited for 7'oclock to come around because we were looking forward to a nice hearty breakfast.

When 7  hit the waitress promptly came over to take our order. I had the special of the day which was smoked salmon hash but I preferred the kahlua banana french toast that my partner ordered. It was exquisite. It wasn't too boozy or too sweet. The bread was light and fluffy. If your in the mood for a sweet vs a savory breakfast, the French toast is their signature must order item. 

I also ordered a rasbperry scone to go, which the employee strangely heated up in what I think might have been a microwave, and then proceeded to give to me in clear plastic bag. This caught me off guard as I'm used to cute to-go containers. Maybe a  flimsy but cute brown cardboard box would have been more appropriate.

Everyone's favorite was the banana kahlua french toast.  It was pleasant surprise how fast the ordering/getting seated was on a Sunday morning.  

It was a bit overpriced (again, based on going to some very delicious brunch places in LA).  Glad we tried it but don't think we have any real desire to come back - would rather try other brunch places in SB.  

The one really annoying thing was that they have the tiniest water glasses I've ever seen next to the water dispenser - they had some sign about the drought, but come on - there are better ways to deal with that (it mostly comes from agricultural watering, not people drinking water at a restaurant).  We had to get up five times during our short meal to refill water.  Some people had normal water glasses around us and we asked for that, but were just brought the tiny glasses.  So yeah, Jeannine's figure out the water situation.

So this time we decided to check it out.  Quite honestly it was a disappointment.  So we ordered the breakfast burrito and currant scone.  Here is the breakdown: 

Pros: 
- super cute place.  You order your food and sit down while it's being prepared and then brought to your table.  - The staff is very friendly.  
- They serve breakfast until 3pm!! 

Cons: 
- the decaf coffee was cold and we had to request a new cup 2 times until they finally got it right.  
- I've had my fare share of scones and although it wasn't very sweet (which is a plus), it was too moist (which is good for a cake not a scone) and it was very bland.  It didn't have that dense texture where you would want to add some jam and butter to it.  
- the breakfast burrito was extremely bland and runny. As soon as I bit into it, a ton of juice came out of the burrito.   I couldn't quite tell where it came from as the eggs were cooked well.  Either way, it was soggy. The potatoes had a nice mixture of sweet potato, regular and fancy potatoes but the portion could have been a bit more so it's proportional to the burrito.   The burrito is definitely a good size to share if you don't want a heavy breakfast.

The six of us shared six dishes. My favorite out of the array of dishes was the Florentine. Although I only got a bite of the egg benedict and toasted english muffin, its taste lefted a memorable mark in me. The creamy sauce tied all the ingredients together perfectly. The eggs were also poached impeccably. It was EGGcellent, I'd have to say.

Besides, the Florentine, I also enjoyed the Tuesday's special: Bacon and Potato Scramble and the Breakfast Quesadilla. The other dishes were also very delectable. Their portions were decent and the ingredients were fresh.

Great food, nothing on the menu is bad. I especially love their ""Apple Jack"" French Toast on the weekends.

If I like it so much, why not five stars? I hate the Santa Barbara restaurant mindset where PEOPLE DONT WAIT ON YOU! You have to stand in a line (especially long on weekends) and order your food from a register (think McDonalds but fancier). Then you feel pressured to PRE-service tip when you complete your order because of the operating system, even though the only service you get is from food runners, and the cashier (but if this is your first time, you won't know that). 

They are a dog friendly establishment, but you must eat outdoors, and the waitstaff gives you the occasional evil eye which subtracts from the dining experience.

I came in during the late morning and was surprised to see how crowded it was.  There were a few people in line in front of me but it moved fast, plus it gave me some time to check out the daily specials.

I was greeted by a stoic cashier. She wasn't unfriendly but she definitely wasn't friendly either.  She seemed like she was ready to be anywhere but there and it showed in her energy.

I ordered 2 coffees, an omlette and their special of the day - breakfast burrito to go.  After paying at the cashier, I wasnt instructed as to where to go so I just kind of hung around until I noticed there were orders coming out from the little coffee bar in the left corner.  

I waited......and waited.....and waited some more.....

After 35 minutes of waiting, finally I flagged down the manager and asked if my order would be coming out some time this year.  He apologized and said yes, that they had gotten ""like 600 orders right before"" I came in. 600? Me thinks not.  

When the order finally came out he said he threw in a few special things for us and apologized again.  Ok, sounds good.  However, when I got it home neither of the breakfast items we ordered had the sides they come with (fruit, biscuit) but there was 1 bran muffin thrown in. Gee thanks!

With that said, the food was fine.  Nothing I would crave but at least I wasn't pissed that my food sucked after all that.

After that, it's all downhill.  We arrived when it was fairly busy to discover quite possibly the stupidest seating/ordering system ever conceived (and I've seen a lot).

First off, as you approach the front entrance, there are basically two-and-a-half lines.  One on the left, one on the right, and then a mass of confused people in the middle trying to understand the difference.  When you finally make your way up to earshot of the woman who is rudely yelling out that you are in the wrong line (as if you should know the system your first time there), you learn that the right hand line is for getting a table.  But not a normal table like you would have with a waiter.  A table ""reservation"".  You get a ticket with a number on it.  Or, if there's no tables ready at the moment (which was the case for us), you don't get a ticket.  You give her your name and then awkwardly stand around and wait to be called to be given a ticket.  (Yes there are 3 elements to be tracking now).  Then, once you are called to get a ticket, you are told to get in the left-hand line and that when you finally get to the front, you can order.  

(**Did I mention you're not allowed to order unless you have first waited on the list, and then waited in the right-hand line?  So some people accidentally waited in the left line only to reach the front and then be told they have to go get on the list to wait in line 1 to get a ticket to wait on line 2**) 

Once you order at the end of the left-hand line, you are told to ""go find your table"".  So you search around trying to match your number with the stand on one of the very many tables there.  Then, you sit down and wait for your food.  

If you want water, you can get it yourself from a 5 ounce dixie cup.  If you ask for a large plastic cup (which they have), you are told ""no, those are only for ice tea.""

If, perhaps, you decide you want to add a food item, order another latte, whatever --- wait for for --- you have to START THE WHOLE PROCESS OVER AGAIN.  Absurd.  

Add to all of this that the restaurant (which probably seats 150) has ONE COED BATHROOM.  Yes, you read that right.

This place needs to pump the brakes on the ordering logistics and just hire some waiters/servers and do it the old fashioned way that has worked for several centuries.  They tried to re-invent the wheel and ended up with a triangle.  Also, build another bathroom for the love of god.

The food was excellent. My wife said her burger(she almost never orders burgers except at In n Out)was the juiciest most flavorfu she had ever had.

You order at the counter and the host reserves your table with a number.

My friend ordered the Norwegian Benedict and the Apple Jack french toast. They both had very positive things to say about their meals. 

A standout moment was when one of my friends noticed the orange juice after paying and asked out waiter if she could switch out her Pellegrino for OJ. He told her it was an extra dollar difference and so she decided to pass. However, the waiter came a back a few minutes later with a glass and told us not to worry about it. 

A few tips: smaller parties have an easier time being seated. They won't let you order unless you already have a table so be wary. I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups.

Excuse me! I'm thinking if you pre-sale a slice you take it out of the display and put it in a box and put it aside, you don't leave it out for the next customer to come up to and start salivating over and drooling for after having heard from friends how great it is! 

So being totally speechless I walk away. Then I see the guy decide to now remove the one slice from the display. What's left is the end with extra frosting all around the side, so I go up to the cashier and order that very last slice and pay for it. 

Next thing I see is the guy go to get the slice for me. He must not have been working in kitchens long becuase he set the to-go container quite a ways away from the slice then took a knife and attempted to extract the single slice upright...only to have it topple over, frosting face down onto the counter-top, SPLAT!

Jeannine's has you covered on all fronts, along with spectacular coffee and a large side of solicitous service, served regardless of the length of the line spilling out onto the sidewalk.

Our group selected delicacies from each of these categories.  The heaping bowl of steel cut oats with fresh fruit made for an attractive and hearty start to the day.   Then came the freak of nature blueberry muffins, seemingly over 50% blueberries by weight and lusciously dense, that somehow managed to be both fat and gluten free: a feat of culinary engineering.  On the other end of the baked-goods-as-health-foods spectrum was the spiced apple coffeecake, a magically moist and subtly spiced bit of morning decadence.  I'll have two.

Jeannine's produces a beautifully executed American breakfast, with fresh and perfectly rendered eggs, bacon, sausage, and ham, and homemade biscuits for a nice twist.   This classic, straightforward combination varies dramatically from restaurant to restaurant, and it's always memorable when they get it right.  A final member of the cast was the light, custardy plate of lemon-ricotta-poppyseed pancakes, which would have sufficed on their own with a little butter and syrup, but instead were crowned by homemade blackberry-ginger sauce and a house-whipped Greek yogurt.

The salad was good although it was skimpy on the amount of chicken and they forgot the dressing. The avocado toast is really more of tuna salad and egg salad with a side of a small avocado toast. My mom really liked her crab melt so thats something good to say for it

This place really is in one of the best areas of Santa Barbara. I really enjoy the ambiance of a French Parisian restaurant that Jeannine's gives off. Do try coming on the weekend, they usually have live guitar playing outside and since it's in the most picturesque part of downtown Santa Barbara, it's a must. 

I like to sit inside when it rains, but even though the outdoor seating has umbrellas, the indoor has a different, more modern ambiance to it. There are many tables indoors and out, but they are not crowded together and there is enough room to order enough food for everyone.

STAFF - 

For some reason, the staff here like to stare - I really don't mind it, except while I eat it's a bit disruptive if I'm out with friends or family - other than that, the service is always tip top and very persistent and accommodating. Even though Jeannine's may be busy at certain times of the day, it's never loud and crowded.

FOOD -

I ordered their Florentine Benedict with salmon (I would greatly recommend adding their salmon or crab to any of their Benedict's - they are absolutely delightful.), and usually order their bottomless mimosas as well whenever I come here for brunch, but also tried their vanilla latte and it was very tasty.

I would definitely recommend coming here if you're a tourist or a local for a nice brunch with friends or family!",2017-02-02 17:14:27

Food came relatively fast and was delivered to our table. We dug right in and it was really delicious! I used the hot sauce for my salad because it was a little lacking in flavor but the poached eggs (for the salad and the Norwegian breakfast) were cooked perfectly! Definitely pretty healthy too.

Observation: good number of people inside, nice décor.
Naïve decision: must be decent.

When we entered, a server immediately asked us where we wanted to sit so she could put our number there. I thought that quite strange, because don't people usually get numbers AFTER ordering? In any case, we chose a table, then lined up to order. The menu neither varied nor impressive. I went for the American breakfast, and he went for the banana French toast. At the front of the line, one of the employees decided to open up the other register, and glared at us, then said, ""I can help you over here."" Really? Glare, then notify? 

While taking our order, she was straight up rude. She smugly asked what I wanted, asked if wheat bread was okay because that's the only type they serve--if I don't have an option, why are you even asking anyway? Then, I inquired whether the potatoes can be hash browns instead, and she gave me the dirtiest look ever, followed by a snarky, ""We don't do that here."" Well, EXCUSE ME.
Then she moved n to him. He asked what's popular there (just to verify his choice), and she curtly replied, ""Our banana French toast is good."" He said, ""Okay,"" but mid-word was cut off by her obviously saying by script, ""Oh! By the way... Our mimosas are buy one get one half off right now, if you guys are interested,"" and totally judged us for thinking about it and saying no. Obviously overwhelmed with disappointment, she then asked, ""Well, do you guys want anything to drink?"" Was just water not okay? Really? So we reluctantly ordered a large orange juice, assuming that for more than half the price of an entree, it would at least be fresh-squeezed. 

The ""large"" OJ came in a not-large-at-all mason jar. The jar idea was cute, but it did not distract me from the fact that the orange juice was clearly not fresh. It was probably Tropicana with low pulp or something. Don't get me wrong--I like Tropicana, but you don't pay like six bucks for a way-too-sweet orange juice at a supposedly 4-star bakery/ cafe. 
After a long, long time, our entrees finally arrived. His French toast looked like a sugar nightmare, and he said it was nothing out of the ordinary, meanwhile confirming the sweetness of the mess. Meanwhile, my American breakfast of eggs, ham, potatoes (thinly sliced ""chips,"" really), and toast (WHEAT, of course) was also nothing out of the ordinary. I kept trying to flag down one server's attention to request butter and jam, but each of my eight attempts was to no avail. But when the lady next to me tried to get her attention, she noticed her right away and got her jam and butter seconds thereafter. Of course.

So, thanks, but no thanks, Jeannine, for your awesome food and prices (everything totaled to $32) and even more awesome treatment.",2013-08-11 07:40:44

Many streets were closed to through traffic to allow social distancing of pedestrian traffic.  Parking was found around the corner & upon arriving, there was naturally a line. It wasn't too long of a wait. Orders are placed at the counter & a number is given to you. You are free to find your own table. There is both indoor & outdoor seating & indoor was ok when we went in October, but I'd check to see what the current situation is. We sat outside, along the side of the building & it's all very pretty. The building has big windows that pretty much open up to the outdoors & views are lovely. Now onto our food!! I had a plate of French toast. Hubby had the breakfast burrito. Yes & yes to both. All the flavors & textures were there. Moistness (I know y'all hate that word but it's important with certain foods) was on point cause I've had many a dry French toast & this wasn't dry. No rubbery burrito here.

They also paired it with a heavy pesto sauce, and shredded cheese, which is not melted at all.  This was a miss: a creamy dill or any sort of cream sauce would've cut the fishy flavor and complemented the crab.  But the pesto was just a weird match.

Another server stopped by our table to check on us. We decided to get mimosas which he, without hesitation, brought to our table. Since there were 4 of us, another lady brought us a bottle of water. There was nice music being played in the courtyard. Across the board, we were more than happy with our choices: chorizo fritatta, salmon omlet, eggs Norwegian & a breakfast burrito. The potatoes were fabulous, not chips but yummy sliced potatoes, blue & sweet potatoes. Then another server came to clear our completely clean plates. The downside of this place is that there is only one unisex bathroom. For the volume of people, they really need another bathroom.

The quality of food we received was fine however they seem to have a problem with whoever orders the food and ensures the bakery is well stocked.  There were very limited bakery items left and absolutely none in the main case.  The attendant said it had been a busy morning.  After we sat at our table, a gentleman came out and apologized but the soup we had ordered was finished (before noon).  Said they did not expect so many people to order soup. Asked about the bakery items and he said he had tried to order more that morning but without luck.  Very disappointing to go to a bakery that is out of bakery items before noon.

I am not a fan of egg Benedict but this version was marvelous.

The sides of potato was not overly salty, the fruit cup was refreshing & healthy.  The french toast also lived up to the hype: doughy, fluffy, airy & buttery, the sausage was juicy & crunchy.

French Toast: These were incredible. We couldn't stop eating them. Lol. Loved the bread that's used and the berries were so fresh!

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the ordering process. The hostess sets you up with a table and then you get in line to order at a counter. The line moves extremely slowly so we waited close to 20 minutes. One person working the register on a Saturday morning just seems inefficient.

I went during Sunday Brunch this weekend and it was the PERFECT Opportunity to try this little place out. I like how you are given a table number and then order. I'd rather not have to tip extra for a brunch place with waiter service... Staff was very friendly and efficient, very knowledgable and accommodating. Wait time for the food was about average for how busy/not busy the restaurant was. 

while waiting for food I was able to soak in and observe the atmosphere. It was semi-casual with a bit of sophistication. They fit a lot of modern touches into an otherwise very old Spanish building. A very nice combination, I must say! Acoustics were quite nice, I would recommend a casual business meeting here if needed. 

The people that brought the food were a bit less than friendly, but I forgive them. Food was presented well, ""Jeannine's"" logo was at the top of the plate. Great for picture taking. I ordered the ""French Toast Breakfast"" which I was surprised to say ""I'm full""... It didn't look like a lot of food in the beginning, but after finishing, it was plenty. I enjoyed the fresh-cut fruits, but not so much the Blackberry (Too many seeds for French toast)... Also the potatoes were a bit lack luster on, but a valiant effort with the variety of colored potatoes.

The line was already out the door when Jo R. and I arrived at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning. How it works here is that you order for your whole party at the counter, but the folks at the register can split your order so that people can pay for just their portions. Menus are available both up front and outside the venue. It was the morning of the 2nd annual Women's March, which explained the crowd, but the line went by super fast, and before long, we were able to find a two-seater outside to enjoy the rapidly-warming weather.

I tried their new small Havana latte with soy milk. The latte came in a coffee cup larger than I'd expected, with condensed milk and topped with cinnamon sugar. This was what I thought a cinnamon dolce latte at Starbucks would be when I was a kid, and this one tastes way bigger. It was very creamy, despite the use of soy, and I would probably stop by for a to-go latte in the future.

And, in honor of cooking at home all week, I splurged on the lobster Benedict. Like the latte, it exceeded all my expectations. I've never had an eggs Benedict dish with hollandaise that rich and creamy before. In fact, it was so rich that I nearly had to take a nap afterward, even with all that caffeine coursing through my veins. The lobster tails they use are juicy, plump, and sweet, making the hollandaise the perfect complement. Combined with the wispy poached eggs and tall English muffins they used, I feel as if I'll never make or taste an eggs Benedict that will ever top the one the cooks at Jeannine's made. 

Their rainbow potatoes (purple yams and sweet potatoes included) were seasoned nicely, and I loved that the fruit bowl was still full of berries even during a winter month. I wish I'd had the stomach to try some of their baked goods, because those scones and salted caramel bars were tempting me like crazy.

I will sing all of Jeannine's praises for the rest of my time in Santa Barbara. In a way, it was better that brunch cost me $30, because I know I lack the self-control otherwise to stay away from this point forth.",2018-01-22 01:49:53

Because there's no service, forget about asking for refills or silverware. Or anything for that matter. Anyway, I wish there was a little more sophistication with the staff, this place has the potential, for sure. It's in a great location. Perhaps all the confusion could be resolved with a sign that says, ""Order in line and we will bring the food to you."" They would then earn another star for clear communication.",2019-06-16 23:12:47

The seating/ordering process is a frustrating and convoluted waste of time. Every time I had a visiting friend who wanted to eat here, I tried to steer them away. Aside from the ridiculous marathon that is ordering and securing a table, the food itself is way too expensive for what it is and the staff doesn't care one teensy little bit if you're satisfied with your meal or experience.

Example? On my most recent visit, I ordered the huevos rancheros without the salsa (since I can't eat tomatoes). When the dish arrived with tomatoes, I (very politely) told the server that I'd asked for it without salsa. He said ""it's just diced tomatoes, not salsa"" and then vanished, never to be seen from again.

I tried to ask someone else about fixing the ($15!) meal that I couldn't eat, but I got a couple shrugs and eventually gave up, since my friends were almost done eating and I didn't want to get back in that monster of a line just to re-order my food and delay everyone.

The service and staff attitude did not match the rating we saw on Yelp, during our Santa Barbara trip. First, you need to order the food on the counter, Good luck if you are a family with kids and there is line. Second, you will be asked to pay gratuity during order, even before you are seated. This is not acceptable to me. How do I know what the actual service would look like? The minimum suggested gratuity is 15%. Third, you would need to go to the counter and get water yourself. So much for the service charge you pay upfront. Fourth, the coffee refills are included. But, the staff only brings you coffee. If you need milk or cream, you would need to get up again and get it yourself. Great!!! Hope, your breakfast still stays hot, by the time you return. Fifth, the attitude of servers was not friendly. You ask for Ketchup, the server may very well ask you to ask your server. Wait till your server returns. Sixth, the cashier charged extra for egg whites without notifying us.

I am sad to say that I used to love this place and I will not be going back unless I need an overpriced yummy cake. I usually order the chicken pesto on toasted ciabatta bread which comes with a side. I was never really a fan of pesto until I tried this sandwich out one day and so I kept going back. In the past year I feel that the quality of the food has gone down considerably. You know what has not gone down are the prices.They have increased.  $21 for a small sandwich, small salad and Arnold Palmer? The chicken used to be moist and tender and the past 3 times I have ordered it it is dry. They changed the bread to something that tasted like cinnamon today and I had to add a lot of sauces that I had at work to make it taste okay. I have taken coworkers on two separate occasions to Jeannine's and the first time did not impress and the second time the server forgot to bring bread and gave my coworker the wrong meal. It had already taken so long to serve that he ate it anyway but said he will also not return. For the price that you are paying I also think you shouldn't have to stand in a line and then hopefully find a place to sit.

The hotel staff had recommended it, the Yelp reviews were predominantly positive, and it was a short walk away. I came here with high expectations.

Jeannine's was certainly a nice (if a bit too cutesy) place but I wasn't wow-ed: 
-- Being a bakery, I was hoping for some fantastic scones (an old weakness). But Jeannine's had only very basic flavors (e.g. plain, blueberry, lemon) and the selection was the same every single day. I have come to expect more creativity than this. (local fruit? interesting combos?) But no. Yawn. I couldn't find one that appealed to me.
-- Many of their signature dishes rely on a slathering of hollandaise sauce, but I've just never been a fan (I'm a mutant, I know).  Plus it feels like cheating.
-- Prices are high here, yet food must be ordered at the counter (aka via a line). Seems like such a high-falutin' spot could afford some actual waitstaff.

That said, it wasn't terrible. My standard, two-egg breakfast used high-quality ingredients and was cooked just right. The setting was attractive, the coffee was good and the staff were reasonably friendly.  

The only food downside was the huevos rancheros special, which was super-boring and bland. (I switched back to the 2 egg breakfast on my third visit.)

Rating is tough. Between 3 and 4 stars for me, but since Jeannine's enjoys a golden reputation and a solid 4-star rating on Yelp, I'm feeling like they are overrated. 3 stars it is.",2018-11-03 02:23:32

I had the Norwegian Benedict (smoked salmon) and it was really tasty. The almond milk latte is also good but they use sweetened almond milk so make sure to not add extra sugar.",2018-01-08 03:07:39

All the tables were taken, so they asked us to wait in line and order only when a table was ready. No problem, we waited less than 5 minutes. I ordered the yogurt and granola, my aunt had two fried eggs and potatoes. They serve Rishi tea and the jasmine tea is delicious. The tables are cozy and close inside, and our food arrived promptly. (Order at the counter, get a number and sit down). 

I've eaten here a few times and at other locations. Sometimes the food isn't consistent and I think it's a bit pricey for what it is so I rated accordingly. But, this location on E. Figueroa is great. Easy parking in a garage sort of behind the restaurant. 

I do like their house-made granola and strawberry yogurt ($11). It's A LOT of granola & calories. But delicious. My aunt had a big plate and I had to help her finish it.

Maybe dial back the effort on ""branding and interior design"" and look into ""sustainability and climate change"".

We started off with two flights (a local red/local white) and the garlic hummus and flat bread. Appetizer was super yummy, and the flights were surprisingly large pours! 

For dinner (this is where it gets fuzzy...was pretty buzzed by the time we ordered)...had the Brussels sprouts (some of the best sprouts ever!) with the veg rissotto...delicious.

I raised the bar on that special because I wanted one of their ""premium"" panini sandwiches and a ""premium"" salad, so we paid what I thought was $2 more. Oh no, read the fine print, they also add $1 a sandwich and $1 a salad on top of the already ""premium"" $2 extra. WTF?  Why not just say its $4 more?  Oh wait, that wouldn't make it much of a ""special"" now would it (insert sarcasm to the fullest here.) 

Anyway, we got home and opened our ""premium"" feast and my chin just about hit the floor after seeing the boxes. The sandwich was like a quarter of a sandwich, not half...and the salad was like a handful of lettuce. I guess it would make a nice appetizer, except for the fact there was hardly anything on my ""premium"" panini. It was mostly toasted bread....I GOT TOAST. The salad, what little there was, was nothing special either. 

The irony is they gave me one of their cards to accumulate points. As in, I would be returning to do so. Sadly, that will not be the case.

As a side note, by other buddy told me he has eaten at other Panera Bread joints and the food was much better, and nothing like the SB location.

For breakfast, I just had their toast and jam. It was thick-sliced, pre-buttered, and pre-jammed with my choice of strawberry jam. All top notch ingredients. 

They have a coffee-roasting model where they rotate through different roasters from different geographies.

We dined here on a recent Sunday evening and were overall very disappointed. We started with 2 wine flights, but the server sped and mumbled his way through the descriptions so fast we couldn't understand a word. He also took the wine menu after we ordered, so we couldn't refer to them to see what we were drinking. But, the flights were reasonably priced and a good size pour, so that helped make up for the lack of flair with the service. We specified that we were going to share 2 appetizers, but they were served to each of us without any small plates for sharing the dishes. I asked him as he walked away for ""2 small plates"", he looked at me and then never returned.  The braised pork ravioli dish was excellent (a bit small for sharing, but delish). We also had the Carmelized Onion and Goat Cheese Tart which was served with baby greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. It was tasty but a bit overdone, as if it had been left under a heat lamp too long.  Everything was cleared away including the silverware, which wasn't replaced once our main dishes arrived. So frustrating! We had to grab new silverware from a nearby empty table.

For our mains, I ordered the Seared Californa Bass, which wasn't very seared at all but still managed to be over cooked. So disappointed to have dry fish in a restaurant, especially at $25 a plate. But, the polenta cake and ratatouille were both good. When I mentioned to our server that the fish was overcooked he said ""that's funny, it's usually UNDER cooked"". My husband ordered the Grilled NY Steak with Bleu Cheese Scented Croquette and Grilled Rapini. Whew....if that is a bleu cheese SCENTED croquette, I'd hate to taste a ""bleu cheese croquette"". I LOVE bleu cheese, especially with beef. But this was just too much warm, melty, rich cheese. We found no evidence of any potato. The rapini was just inedible, very very bitter and chewy. It was almost as if they cooked the part you're supposed to trim off and throw away. The beef was rich and tasty and a tad over coooked, but after all of the fat was cut away it didn't leave a very big portion. 

So, overall I felt that they had the ""B Team"" working on Sunday night. Service is a big part of the dining experience, and when the food also doesn't measure up, it just makes for a very disappointing over all experience. If the food was A+, we probably could have overlooked an apathetic and bored service staff.",2010-08-24 22:17:49

We waited about 4 minutes at the podium before our server greeted us, and sat us on the patio. At 5:30 we were 1 of only 2 tables, but it took forever to place an order, and then our appetizers came out before our drinks. Helpful as our server tried to be, he was obviously lost (age or lack of training, who knows.) Still, as the sun began to dip behind the buildings on State, and as hotties and bums, families, farmers and freaks all happily converged upon each other in a typical Santa Barbara one-love, its all good state-of-mind, time didn't seem to matter.

Everything was fresh and made to order. The Caesar was a lovely salad comprised of a quarter head of crisp romaine with plenty of cheese, well-dressed and served with two large crouton slices of bread.

I ordered the braised short ribs which were served on a bed of grilled corn and Kale with fingerling potatoes and roasted garlic. Just a touch too salty, the dish was still very good and all the flavors married well.

My wife's Chicken Scallopini was also served with fingerling potatoes as well as roasted garlic, capers, mushrooms, white wine, lemon juice and a generous amount of melted Mozzarella. I was impressed by how well the wine, lemon and garlic still kept their individual flavors, while creating the prerequisite sauce for the dish.

Dessert was a well executed rice pudding with bananas and pistachios which I ordered to go.

While the food was good, one last disappointment was that while sitting on the patio looking into the restaurant's large glass windows, I couldn't help but notice the several dead winged termites, an old half-used sugar packet and an accumulation of salt and pepper along the interior window sill.

If you want to work here?
Know they limit internet to about 20 minutes
Good coffee and good AC
Servers do not get their Tips
They get gift card for food at Panera. Is that legal
They are under staffed
Always
Portions are tiny
But some things are really great
Management Staff does not seem happy a lot 
Snappish and micro managing is very visible
They do not have staff meetings to work through issues
The owners are apparently non participants whose only concept is the bottom line
It is very apparent a few employees work hard and show up while others ride their coat tails
The space is nice
But the energy often feels tense
I was in the restaurant business from the time I was 9. Shucking oysters. Bussing. Dishes. It's a great work experience I just wish the staff looked happier. There are couple of Managers that I don't think should work with the public ( or anyone for that matter) they either do not pull their weight or are shouters and shirt fused
Behaviors that I believe are a liability
Know I am tough
But I see what I see
And feel what I feel
Restaurants and cafes. Coffee houses and diners 
Are places that are supposed to offer comfort and nourishment to the body and soul
We seek these places after hard days and long nights to replenish us. But when I see an employee being yelled at or insulted by staff or management.  It hurts my heart. Sadly Panera helps put the C in Corporate. Too bad. It could d beastly be a community oasis instead of "" the lesser of two evils "" or "" the only choice""
The staff would be happier The customers
When I asked about staff meeting and how they work through issues I was flatly told
They don't
I was told they were afraid

I was craving pasta as usual, and wanted to eat the Lobster Putanesca I enjoyed at Pierre Lafond last time. Unfortunately, it was no longer on the menu.

I opted for the Shrimp Pappardelle with roasted mushrooms, asparagus and shellfish cream. I really had high hopes for this dish, but it came swimming in sauce. You could have called it shrimp stew and it would have been more fitting. As far as asparagus goes, I found about 5 small cut up pieces in there. The rest was pasta, shrimp, tomatoes and some mushrooms. What a waste at $21. 

My dining companion had the Mushroom Sacchetti Pasta with roasted mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and asparagus in a light Chardonnay sauce and it was pretty much 80% sun dried tomatoes. The pasta was very dense and cheesy, and the sauce was anything but light. There should have been more than 5 small pieces of asparagus to balance out the forest of sun dried tomatoes. $18 for this, I think not.

As far as service goes, it was mehhhh at best. We were greeted by the host after waiting for a few minutes at the front. The waiter seemed inexperienced and in a rush to hurry us out. Why? The restaurant wasn't even that busy! One such instance that perturbed me was when he came up to ask me if I was done eating, while I was in MID BITE! Ummm, hello? Does it LOOK like I'm done? Geeez. 

This brings me to another thing I've noticed lately about restaurants  trying to rush you out. Please don't do that. It makes me feel unimportant and that you just care about your next guests. Also, it discourages me from wanting to return or recommend you to others. 

In conclusion, skip Pierre Lafond. There are several better dining options on State Street.

We started off with two glasses of the Zin (which was very good for the price point-$8.00). Then we tried the vegetarian chili which was excellent. We then ordered two turkey burgers. One with no bun and a salad, and one with a bun and  salad. Our waiter brought out my wife's turkey burger (alone) and as he placed it on the table I said: ""That's strange that you only have one burger and not mine."" The waiter replied: ""Yes it is, let me go check what happened in the kitchen."" Since I did not feel it right that my wife's food get cold, we both decided that she should start her meal. We waited 14 minutes and finally a food runner brought out my turkey burger. Our waiter?? No idea where he disappeared to. We both figured that he was embarrassed by his mistake and just did not want to show his face again. Which he was successful in doing. He did NOT show up again over the next 20-25 mins as we finished our turkey burgers and wine. He did finally show up to drop off the check as move on. There was not apology for what just happened. No explanation. Nothing. As he came by to pick up my credit card, my wife explained: ""We don't feel it's right that you never showed up again after you dropped off the first burger. We weren't even given an explanation by you as to what happened. We'd like you to take something off of our check."" The waiter proceeded by taking off our chili. BUT, we had to be the one's to ask.

That is amazing customer service!

1- There was no creme brulee on the desert menu.  Call it a personal quirk if you will.
2- They shut down relatively early, along with all of the other restaurants in the area...around 8:30-9pm.  I guess that's the status quo for restaurants in this area.  Considering their array of wines, I wish they were open later so that I could have had ""seconds"". :)",2009-11-25 06:54:18

We stumbled upon it by chance while walking down State St. We were greeted by a woman who offered us a table outside. It was a prime spot for people watching, sun bathing, and salad eating. Not long after taking our seats, someone brought us glasses of ice water, each with a slice of cucumber floating underneath the ice. That's right, cucumber. This was exceptional. We immediately knew that we had come to the right place. Neither of us even like cucumber that much, but to have it in the water was original, and added a touch of luxury to what was otherwise an everyday run of the mill glass of ice water. Our waitress came by to take our orders, but we weren't quite ready. My girlfriend wanted the Kale salad with mung beans, but I couldn't decide between the Cobb Salad and the caprese sandwich. Finally I made up my mind and we enjoyed a few more sips of cucumber water before a black shirted man approached the table with a bread basket. There were two kinds of bread, one white and one that looked like some kind of grain bread. The grain bread was fantastic. It was soft and moist. Our waitress returned to take our orders. 10 minutes later we were enjoying a kale salad with mung beans and a Cobb salad while basking in sunlight watching all kinds of people. At this point we knew we had made it in life. All of our personal shortcomings, past failures, missed doctors appointments, and disappointing dining experiences had been superseded by this moment in time. I had ordered a Firestone 805 beer, which I'd never had. It was absolutely delightful. Hoppy, with a hint of citrus, and refreshing, it was everything I wanted from a beer. My girlfriend got a Pinot Gris that was on tap. She loved it. I tasted it. I was blown away. Maybe my mind was still spinning from the water, but I could have sworn there was a hint of cucumber when I smelled the wine. Of course there was no sliced cucumber in the wine, although if there had been, it would have been fine as the wine bistro from this point on could do no wrong. The Cobb salad was perfectly dressed, and the chunks of chicken were perfectly sized so that I didn't have to cut them. The kale salad was wonderfully Asian in that all American way that only happens in California. And I say that possibly because of the mung beans, or the dressing, or because I don't know what else to say. We ate the salads and asked for the check, which was brought to us swiftly. Everything was perfect. We ate everything, except for the cucumber slices in the water and a few chicken chunks. Thank you, Wine Bistro, for a most satisfying dining experience.",2014-01-06 01:23:34

I would order it again. I ordered mine medium.

So I go with champagne. 

The mussels with the chorizo are delicious and they don't skimp on the portions. Get plenty of bread because you won't want any of the broth to go to waste. 

Our server/wine aficionado was Kelsey (i think) and she was incredibly helpful for those of us who have to google the correct spelling of ""wine-aficionado"". 

The beet and goat cheese salad was also delicious and the presentation only added to it (sort of a greens/goat cheese/beet tower on a bed of beet slices). 

My only reason for giving this place four stars is the setting. They need to do something to hide the ""back of the house"" operations from the front. The front is open, airy, and classy. 

For that reason, we still do a lot of take out from Pierre Lafond (anything with duck will blow you away, even after 15 minutes in the front seat of your car).

Food quality:
Ordered the Chia Seed Bowl (like oatmeal), Toast, and French Toast.
The Chia Seed Bowl gets a 4 star. Tasted ok and felt healthy. So definitely recommend it.
However, the French Toast and the Toast get a 1 star. And that set the poor impression in me about the quality of the food and the kitchen.
The Strawberry jam tasted very ""canned"" like. Did not taste fresh. Just like a jelly mix and fake/flavored fast.
The French Toast was not well done at all. Tasted simply like a cinnamon roll with fake jam on it.

Kitchen:
It feels as if the kitchen is shared with their bar next door and so the Breakfast that we had did not have a taste of clean morning food. It felt more like a bar food. Despite them trying to make it look super healthy.

Overall the taste of the food, quality, and gut feel on cleanliness was poor.

But the other night I went with my Niece from Italy and she had on a previous  night had the the special of what  I believe was the Black Cod. She and her guest raved about it.
So upon my return from a month abroad (I live in SB) she wanted to treat me. We made reservations the previous day for 830 pm .
Well when we arrived they said they were closed but after some reluctance put us at our table at 830 pm.
service was passable but I ordered the mussel with chorizo dish,she had the Caesar salad,with the seafood stew.
The salad was good I tried it, her seafood stew looked a bit tired and gray, but she said it was good.
My mussel plate on the other hand was like I had seen in a previous post here, Inedible . It was like so over powering with tomatoes and chorizo and salt, I could not finish it. it was like the cook thought they were doing me a favor and adding all they had from the bottom of the kettle.
I should have sent it back but my niece was so proud to take me there,I said nothing.
So this is why I write now.
From my view the plates need to be made with a much more subtle hand and sense. More will never be better in cooking ! The chorizo was too much and not really the best quality ,it was like cubed summer sausage ! one could not even taste the mussels!
But to be fair I will try it again someday.

I came here for the first [and clearly my last] time over the 4th of July weekend with four close girlfriends in tow.  Our waitress was just too damned preoccupied with all of the other demanding customers in the dining room to pay much of any attention to my table.** [Insert sarcasm here.  The dining room was seemingly empty, give or take a couple of patrons peppered throughout the space.]  

Okay, I admit it.  We ordered a REALLY complex meal.  Read: 5 girls, 5 salads.  Oh, and can we all get some coffee and some orange juice?  Oh, and waters.  Yes, 5 waters, please.  Oh, and maybe a bruschetta platter as a starter and some spring rolls.  Oh, and we apologize in advance for submitting such a complicated order.  Do forgive us.

Riddle me this: Why in the hell did it take an HOUR to deliver 5 salads?  Seriously.  And why on god's good earth did our waitress refuse to acknowledge the long wait for our food or even cordially say goodbye to us after we got up and left and try to apologize for all of the hassle we experienced?  Why didn't she say that the apps and all of our beverages and my salad, which were all magically left off of our final bill, were actually taken off cogniscently as an effort on her part, a make-good, if you will?  Instead of feeling comfortable and at ease, my party and I felt alienated and bullied throughout our entire meal.

Maybe our stunningly good looks intimidated her?  Perhaps our oozing charisma and San Francisco intelligence convinced her that she was a lesser being?  

Who knows.  What I DO know is that I will NEVER return to Pierre Lafond on my next visit to the SBC.  Seriously, get your act together, Pierre.",2008-07-07 06:33:22

We were finally able to use it for date night yesterday and it was an epic fail.  When I informed our server that we had the groupon she said our flights were either the Santa Barbara red or white flights.  Not sure why we were limited since all the flights cost the same but we went with one of each anyway.  My husband chose the sausage flatbread and asked what was on it.  Our server said it was just cheese, marinara sauce and sausage.  Since my husband tends to be allergic to certain foods we went with that because of the lack of ingredients.  However,  when we got it there happened to be onions and possibly bell peppers on the flatbread which my husband picked off.  Not sure why the server didn't just mention that to begin with.  Overall the flatbread was ok.  The My husband chose the chicken and I chose the scallops for our entrees.  My husband asked to substitute spinach.  Which was nice because the server offered when we inquired what frize was (which she said was a bitter green leaf vegetable). When our food came there was mustard sauce on my husband's chicken which he didn't know was going to be all over it.  He ended up just wiping it off. He said the chicken was dry and he wasn't expecting a spinach salad, he thought he was going to have sautéed spinach.  In any case he didn't touch it. I tried to like my scallops but they were very salty.  The risotto that came with the scallops was ok, but didn't blow me away. Our server was very attentive up until we got our meal then she seemed to disappear where we had to flag her down just to get our food boxed and the check.  Then to top it all off my husband just told me his stomach hurts and he thinks it is from last night's dinner..

I have been wanting to check this place out for quite some time as it appears to have an intimate yet fun atmosphere. So a few weeks ago my friend LM and I went for dinner and wine while we caught up with one another. 

We were sat inside near the window, great for people watching those on State Street. Our server came by promptly to take our orders. To start, we each ordered the Around the World flights of wine and the Farmer's Market Tomato and Arugula Pesto Flatbread to share. The wine was great. The flatbread seemed a bit burnt and tasted blah. We also each ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup which was delicious.

The thing that ruined the experience was the service. Shortly after ordering our soups, the soft Jazz-y music stopped and Lil' Wayne started blasting from the speakers. My friend and I were shocked, as this did not seem as such an establishment, especially to play the unedited version of some songs. We were confused but tried to ignore it and resume our meal. Few songs later, the regular music was back on. Our server also disappeared for a while during our time at the restaurant, and once he reappeared he seemed stoned and was behaving unprofessionally; hiccuping and laughing randomly... in general just being awkward. We quickly finished our food and hunted him down to pay the bill and get out of there. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but this strange experience has turned me off completely.",2013-12-17 03:49:50

You can easily find an over priced, bland restaurant with even more bland servicing staff on state st of Santa Barbara, but not at Pierre Lafond.

Burger was probably the most perfectly grilled. seasoned one that my husband (burger fever man) ever had. Flat bread I got tasted so fresh you can taste every ingredient instead of overly cheesy, greasy, salty taste. 

As it's been almost a month since our visit here, I forgot what wine we paired with our food but it was excellent as well.
Not to mention complimentary appetizer bread. 
Oh, those were just ridiculously good...

We were surprised that not only the servers but a busser was well-trained. 
As my husband is a manager at a fine dining restaurant, we can usually tell how a restaurant is run just by seating there for 20-30min. Here we could tell they train bussers' language, the way they communicate with customers. 
A lot of restaurants don't even care how servers converse with customers, let alone bussers. 

We went there on Monday night.
Usually restaurants schedule sous chef or training chef for monday night because it's least busiest time. But when we came here on Monday night, without much expectation, we still had as decent food as other fancy places in Beverly Hills or West Hollywood.
They do care about the consistency of their quality food. 

We were very very satisfied with our decision for the last night of our summer vacation.

This review is long overdue as my colleagues and I were here last summer for business. The first night we were there, we were tired after flying in from Maui all day then driving from LAX, one of my coworkers had been to SB before and said that we should go to this Mexican place on State street - it'll be fun and casual. We get there, the wait staff was utterly rude so we walked on our reservation and Wine Bistro was right next door and could take us right in. 

The Caramelized Onion & Goat Cheese Tart and the cheese platter for appetizers were awesome (we're a wine and cheese kind of group). I don't even remember what we had to eat, but the desserts, these desserts are to die for. We stuffed ourselves, but never turn down the option to at least browse the dessert menu and thank goodness we didn't. Fig Tarte Tatin with Bleu Cheese Ice Cream AND Strawberry Shortcake with Basil Sauce. The four of us shared one of each and loved every last bite of it. The bleu cheese ice cream is not recommended on its own, but with this perfectly balanced fig tarte tatin in its flaky crust - perfect. And I'm not a cake eater. but I love anything basil infused, the shortcake was no exception, the cake itself was very moist which I appreciated, the strawberries were so fresh and delicious, and again the perfect amount of the basil sauce over the strawberries and soaked into the cake was absolutely heavenly!

We all decided to stroll in. 

First thing I ordered - coffee! I have to say that the portion size for the coffee was quite large. But very good. It was a really delicious cup of coffee. 

Having missed having a breakfast. I noticed that they were still serving brunch/breakfast food. I decided to go with the Bistro Benedict. I'm a fan of poached eggs, English muffins, ham (or pretty much any pig product). It was delicious.....hollindaise sauce was rich, creamy. It was perfect. Went well with the coffee and was the perfect breakfast for a lunch in Santa Barbara.

The service was good. I recall our server being very attentive and friendly, to a bunch of tourists like us. Cause, yeah - we had tourism written all over us.

1. Never have this sandwich if you are going for lunch, it's kind of appetizer also I can compare it to a small taco wilh most of the stuffing is lettuce.
2. There was hardly any chicken inside the sandwich but on the ad they show it is stuffed well and all that crap.
3. Lastly I would not prefer this place because of overpriced and poor quality food except their cakes and donuts are fine.",2014-10-22 21:00:58

Lovely touch to serve water with cuke slice, so fresh. The bread basket is inspired. We each had a wine flight & enjoyed very much; nice selection, generous glasses. Shared the roasted mushroom, butternut squash & taleggio flatbread, very nice.  The mussels in white wine were the star for us--absolutely incredible.

We were walking around and decided to sit down and have a pair of wine flights. The flights each come with three different wines, so we figured that should be a reasonable amount of wine for two people. So imagine our surprise when the waitress walks out with six glasses of wine, each of them easily 2/3 full. Fortunately, we weren't driving that day, and we damned well weren't going to let good wine go to waste... :)

Fast-forward a bit, I proposed, she said yes, we decided to get married in Santa Barbara. The time came for us to decide on a reception caterer, and so we got in touch with Hilary at Pierre Lafond. She set up an absolutely over-the-top tasting for us. Phenomenal food, incredible wine, and she was on hand throughout the tasting to answer all of our questions.

Surprise surprise, we decided to go with Pierre Lafond for our reception. Hilary was on-site to manage everything, and the whole thing couldn't have gone more smoothly. Our guests raved about the food all weekend, the wine never stood a chance, and Hilary and her staff were on their A-game.

As for suggestions? You can't go wrong with any of the Lafond wines. The goat cheese tart is out of this world. The flatbreads are great for an appetizer, or just as a snack to go with your monster wine flight. All in all, though, it's hard to go wrong here.",2012-05-18 20:56:51

First let me give you the good... the place was busy but I still got through the line quickly, the people seemed nice and my lunch came within a few minutes after ordering.    But the sandwich was absolutely NOTHING to rave about.   I ordered a turkey hot Panini.    The turkey was that rubbery turkey that tastes like it came out of a package--you know the stuff, can't really tell if it is turkey or ham because all the packaged Oscar Meyer (or smart and final) meats kind of have that same flavor....  Now when they turkey was microwaved (yes I am sure that was how they heated it up) they took the two or three slices cut them into triangles (all stuck together as it came out of the package) and threw it on the bread with some cheese.   The result was a big glob of meat in one corner of the sandwich...  I literally had to disassemble my sandwich and re-make it at my table so that I could eat it.  Should a customer EVER have to do that?  

Go to South Coast Deli, Panini, Nortons, Three Pickles or even VONS deli for a much, much, much better sandwich!!!!!  We are so lucky to live in a town with so many great choices for a wonderful sandwich.",2012-03-24 15:43:53

The rapini that came to the table was almost inedible because it seems they must take the raw rapini toss it on the grill for 5 minutes and serve...WRONG.

Step 1. Blanch in boiling water 1-2 minutes and then remove to ice water.
Step 2. Squeeze out excess water with a kitchen towel.
Step 3. Slice some garlic, heat some olive oil in a saute pan and toss in some garlic and some chile flakes and barely brown garlic.
Step 4. Toss in rapini add a bit more oil and season with S&P. Heat high once you put in rapini.
Step 5. Eat rapini that actually has some flavor.

GOT IT BRO?

As for the rest. 

Iceberg Wedge -  fine but the quality of everything on the dish was equal to a chain restaurant.

Lobster Putanesca - Pretty freekin bad.

NY Steak - yes it did taste like a steak, the rapini was (see above) and the potato thingy was fair, i would rather have good fries or plain mashed.

Farm Cake - Are you kidding me...the only thing missing was the Drakes rapper.  Overly sweet flavorless cake...yum. If you want to see what real bake goods should taste like go to D'Angelo's.",2010-09-19 23:03:09

The last 3 or 4 times I've been in this location my carry out order is usually not ready (quoted 10 minutes and I show up at the 15 minute mark). In addition, no one behind the counter in the carry out line acknowledges your existence. Anywhere from 2 to 5 employees will walk by you, not say a word, and then maybe a couple minutes later decide to ask if you are picking up an order. 
This morning in particular, the girl behind the counter that was ""helping"" me had a scowl on her face and an attitude while asking me what I was there to pick up. The management needs to do some serious re-evaluation of who they choose to hire and how they are training their employees. Having a friendly smile and GREETING A CUSTOMER go a long way. A simple ""hi, welcome! Give me a minute and I'll be right with you"" makes a world of difference. It acknowledges the person and let's them know they are actually valued.

Mournful, monotonous, and superficial though it may be, it is paradise. There is no other -- Jean Baudrillard quotes 

Is Santa Barbara a paradise?  Depends on your perspective of course.  Certainly both the best and worst of the West...gorgeous scenery and weather mixed with obscene wealth counterbalanced by an increasing homeless population.  Meanwhile the middle and upper middle classes who do the real work struggle to afford to live here.  

And yet this is still a favorite day trip...the hiking is solid, the wineries are to notch although the restaurants are just now catching up.  And the people watching on a beautiful Spring day sitting on the patio of a joint like Pierre Lafond is priceless.  Gorgeous women and men...not so gorgeous women and men who think they are gorgeous :)  The homeless of course both talkative and benign and mean and threatening.  Low riders with sun glass wearing dogs in passenger seats.  European and Asian tourists with filled shopping bags.  Teenagers and tweens acting cool.  Southern California does not have a great urban environment but the people watching diaspora can be just as fun at a place like SB (if a little less diverse).

As for the Bistro itself, the wine selection here is ample and consists of more than just wines from Lafond's Santa Barbara Winery.  They also have closeout pricing on wines and we sat on the patio with a $19.00 Brassfield Sauvignon Blanc with flatbread & hummus (both very good).

We waited for 5 minutes before being seated on the patio. I noticed that service was pretty damn slow. I'm not sure why, but based on other people's reviews, that seems to be normal here.

We order 2 bellinis, lobster putanesca for me and salmon club sandwich for him. 

Bellinis were standard, but hit the spot. I mean, gave me tingles in my head. 

Lobster putanesca was good, except for the lobster itself. Booo. It was too hard an chewy. I did like the angel hair pasta and the sauce though. 

S had to send his sandwich back because the bacon was not cooked fully. He likes bacon crispy and not fatty like it came. Can't blame him!

We had another bellini each to finish off the meal! 

Overall, I'd come back. But, I would order something different, along with a mimosa next time. 

Side note: An artist was sitting behind me and sketched a caricature of us. It was a cute touch to lunch, although he just got my back,  but it still looks like me! Didn't really look like S' face though. Oh wells. It was Easter, so we bought it off him for $10.

The wine flight for $14 seemed liked a great idea and a great deal to boot.

He asked for some light wines - yet they brought him a merlot and some other wines that were pretty awful.  The portions were generous but the wine was not good.  Honestly, $2 buck chuck would have been better.

My zinfandel flight was just ok.  One wine was ok but the other 2 were barely drinkable.  Doesn't Santa Barbara have better wine bistros than this?  Sorry but in LA we can get a great meal and great wine for 2 for $100 and be impressed. I guess not here.

Goat cheese and carmalized onion tart, served with argula and lemon balsalmic -- best dish of the day. The greens nicely complimented the sweetness of the tart. Yum. 

Roasted tomato and goat cheese flat bread with pesto -- I like pizza a little well done, but this was too burned for my taste. I probably should have sent it back, but we were starving and downed it. Nothing special. 

BBQ Salmon BLT on grilled sourdough -- while this sounded interesting, it was only OK. The salmon was cooked well and anything tastes good with bacon and mayo, but it was just forgettable.

Santa Barbara local review; I cannot believe how often we encounter this.  Decent to great restaurants ruined by lousy service because the management hires students instead of professionals.  This is typical along State St. and has ruined many a night out up and down State St. 

1) Restaurant had 2 tables full inside, 3 outside with 2 wait staff and a bus boy.  Should not have been a problem.
2) We sat 10 minutes before presented with menus.
3) Glass of Pinot Noir served with cork floating in it.  I returned it, 6 minutes later the waiter (Eddy) reported he tried to strain out the cork (!), but would have to open a new bottle.  10 minutes later I got my glass of wine.
4) Eddy disappeared when not dropping off plates at our table.
5) We had to stop employees twice to fill our water glasses.
6) We never got served the side dish we ordered - but didn't get billed for it either.

Our experience here exceeded any expectations we may have had!  The dinner included our choice of two flatbreads, two entrees, and two desserts.  Our server, who was amazing the entire time, took the time to explain all of our options and also explained that we got to choose two wines (2 oz pours) for our wine flight.  Most of us chose to include a zin blend for one of our wine pours.  Shortly after we placed this order someone else came up (either the manager or another server) and apologized for the fact that they were out of that particular wine.  He generously offered to bring over the two bottles that they did have of the blend and we could make our own blend.  He proceeded to place a bottle of Primitivo and Sangiovese (both Santa Barbara Winery) on our table, stating ""scout's honor.""  We poured our blends (and then some), politely telling him the next time he walked by that we were being tempted with the bottles sitting on our table.  He stated ""ah, we don't mind you tempting yourselves a little more.""  So not only were they completely generous with their wine, but the Primitivo was simply amazing!! 

For our flatbreads I ordered the pesto, goat cheese tomato, which was AWESOME...the goat cheese was so creamy. My boyfriend ordered the smoked chicken roasted red pepper flatbread which he also enjoyed.   They were very generous portions as well. For my entree  I ordered the Seared Sea Scallops with asparagus, sweet potato, mushroom rissoto for my entree and what a treat!!  The sea scallops were cooked perfectly and although the risotto was heavy for my liking, it was absolutely delicious.  The lobster sauce made that entrée! While I don't eat red meat, my boyfriend was raving about his NY strip steak and stated it was cooked perfectly.  The best part by far were the desserts...oh...my...god!!  The voucher was only good for two desserts on their menu so we split both.  The molten chocolate lava cake was sinfully delicious.  The sherry wine cake looked so simplistic, but let me just say...WOW!!  We all couldn't stop eating it.  It was like a hot, sugary, melt in your mouth sponge cake.

Full Review: I've been to rebar a few times now and each time been impressed.

Their tap cold brew is silky as all hell and goes down so nicely. They've pulled me one of the best cappuccinos I've had also, with texture like a cloud.

Aside from the coffee they also have a small menu of brunch items and pastries, with omni and veg options. One of the times I've been I had their chia porridge with berries and house pecan milk; I definitely recommend.

With a clean interior and prompt staff, overall Rebar is a great cafe for everyone of all dietary preferences.",2016-05-15 17:55:01

Everything was decent enough. The sandwiches had hardly anything on them and they seemed to be poorly constructed. The soup was good, but nothing to scream over. 

We spent $27 for two people and one drink. I left feeling disappointed, cafe fresco (sp?) is about the same price and 100x better. I wish we went there. 

Parts of the ""steak and cheddar"" sandwich were ice cold while other parts were hot. This leads me to think they microwave it. When I'm paying $9 for a half empty sandwich I'd at least like it not to be microwaved. :-(

Visiting Santa Barbara I was excited to try different places each day to get a sense of what the town had to offer. Rebar Coffee looked cool--like your standard hip west coast café with good food, great drinks, and a rustic/urban/cozy aesthetic that anticipates Starbucks' next interior rebrand by about 5 years.
And my lukewarm response to Rebar is largely because it didn't do anything to set itself apart from any other ""hip west coast café"": the drinks were average, the food selection was minimal and unremarkable in flavor, and the customer service was indifferent at best.
Rebar looks like it could be so much more but appearances are deceiving. It seems to rest on looks alone and doesn't deliver the substance.",2017-06-26 21:04:46

would i return? hells. yes. i ate every last drop of food on all of the plates brought out.  i didnt even have room for my wine.  when janani s. leaves her wine un-drunk, you know the food is good.

There is definitely something wrong with the morale there and I can't understand it because if you go right next-door to chipotle you will notice a huge difference. The employees at the chipotle right next-door are always happy welcome mean and just simply fun to talk to. Literally every single time we got into Panera bread the people who work behind the counter seem to absolutely hate what they're doing and hate people coming in. We actually heard them arguing today with someone who had paid for two lattes and they only made one of them and argued with the person that they had not paid for two without looking at the receipt and then finding that they did in fact pay for two. They don't speak out so you can't hear them well when they're asking you questions and you have to ask them over and over again and we are not old by the way. My husband said the name of the breakfast sandwich he was ordering and the woman gave them a snotty reply back saying we have a lot of breakfast sandwiches which ones do you want to which he said the exact name of the one over again. To which she said in a snotty tone oh. The time before this last that I was there I was waiting for a take-out order and was watching all of the food pile up in pileup at the service station and no one coming to pick it up to put on the tables for others. There were several suits that were sitting there long enough that they were probably not cold anymore. The person plating everything kept asking for someone to help them and take everything out to the tables but no one was showing up to help. Then I watched two people go off shift and walk right past the food just to rush out of work making it very clear that they don't care very much about their jobs are the people there it's simply about picking up a paycheck and leaving and doing is mediocre of a job as you can possibly do for a paycheck.

Since many of you don't know the Collier family, our motto is, ""have food, will travel!""  Anywho, because we decided to go to Santa Barbara on empty stomachs, we were looking for a restaurant.  Thank goodness for Yelp!

We were almost ready, scratch that, we were starting to turn on each other and we found this restaurant on Yelp.  I decided to call to double check that they were open and luckily, they were.  We went to the restaurant and were very impressed!  DO NOT  come to this place if you only want a bite of something, their portions are HUGE and very good!  And, because they're a wine bar, they have an extensive wine list.  Plus, they also do a wine flight.  For $15.00, you get a flight of 3 wines.

For those that love a great view, the restaurant overlooks State St. and is next to an outdoor vendor.  It's a great place for people watching and seeing what the outdoor vendor has.  Since it's in the middle of the action, you're close to everything!

As per usual, I left late and hit traffic, thinking it would be lovely to take PCH as much as possible. Lesson learned - PCH is not worth the traffic until after Santa Monica. So after an (unnecessary albeit often beautiful) 8 hour drive, I cruise in to SB, check in to my hotel, smuggle my dog in and back out and look to find some eats. 

Luckily I had done my Yelp research and knew that Pierre Lafonde was one of few places that would allow my pupster on the patio. True the the reviews, the atmosphere is sophisticated and cleanly designed, the service was very friendly, and the food was great! I started with a glass of the Santa Barbara Winery Sauvignon Blanc and on the suggestion of my (very cute) waiter, ordered the prawn and artichoke pesto flatbread.

The staff and the coffee were 5 stars. I couldn't have asked for a better barista than Andie. The chalkboard with the cold brews was fully stocked everyday with an amazing variety of coffees and lattes. I religiously went to rebar every morning for my coffee. A couple of weeks back I was pretty busy for a few days and maybe missed 3 days of going to rebar. Which was a lot for me. When I returned back I had noticed a couple things. One the chalkboard was completely empty besides one coffee. And I had also heard the 3 staff members who had been there forever were all no longer working there. Im not opposed to new staff even though I was sad to hear the old staff was gone. But the new staff is just completely clueless. When I saw the chalkboard walk completely empty, I asked for a simple Iced coffee with some vanilla in it. The girl gave me an iced coffee with this thick goopy syrup in it that would NOT stir into my drink. So every sip was just bites of a thick sugary syrup. Fair to say it was disgusting. I have never seen a place go from such high standards to what they are now so quickly. I walked in the other day hoping maybe just maybe they started filling up the chalkboard again and might be back to having the delicious cold brew vanilla lattes but yet again a completely empty chalkboard. This time I decided to just walk out. Sad to say but I can not see myself going back there. It is just not what it used to be.

The Wine Flights are a perfect way to sample some local wines. The first night my friend & I stopped in, we arrived during Happy Hour (pure luck). We did the Chardonnay Wine Flight with the Flatbread dish and a Cheese sampler. The cheese platter was generous and the Flatbread was yummy. We never got around to dinner because we sampled all the appetizers.
Our second visit was better with a build-your-own wine flight and after dinner we finished with the most incredible dessert: the strawberry & tangerine shortcake. Don't miss this spot!",2010-08-11 03:26:08

I almost ordered the whole menu but the waiter was nice enough to inform me I ordered more than enough for 3 people.

-f_yh4f4lkuxNsFlWkJrvA,W83aZrDrYKwycCHB_eOYYg,m4xrhESFLaA7PiddXeg2aw,5,1,0,1,"The ""new Piatti"" (but don't call it that because this place blows Piatti out of the proverbial water) is a joy. 

Piatti was the first place in SB I ate after I took the graduate fellowship at UCSB. It remained the prettiest fine dining Italian in SB but I never thought it held a candle (apparently Sandy has deluged my language or consciousness with water imagery) to Ca Dario, Tre Lune/Bucatini (same owners) or Via Vai. 

The big draw of Piatti: the rustic beauty of the large, expansive space in the Upper Village of Montecito. I loved the bread and the spicy balsamic/chili flake dipping sauce with a bit of oil. And the 7/glass Piatti house cab was great. Lasagna good. But I had mediocre meal after mediocre meal there and gave up on it except for wine and bread at the bar. 

The Wine Bistro is even more beautiful than Piatti with an impressive open kitchen where the wood fired pizzas are lovingly made by the great kitchen staff. I went for the first time to brunch last weekend and it was quite possibly the best brunch, aside from Four Seasons (expensive and buffet-style so inherently unhealthy), I've eaten in SB. 

The choices were plentiful but I went with the autumn squash, goat cheese, truffle oil, mushroom and sage pizza and I ate twice as much as I intended. I drank the cheapest white by the glass, a perfectly respectable Pinot Grigio (or Gris maybe) at 8/glass. 

There were half a dozen things which tempted me including the chicken cacciatore and the avocado/beet/peppers/goat cheese sandwich on focaccia 

I've been there for dinner and the summer succotash and gazpacho are wonderful. The paintings are a perfect complement to the slightly less Italian but still rustic space with the Mexican tile from Piatti preserved (terra cotta). 

Each room is slightly different and I thought the service was great. Some people remain from the old Piatti which was a real hangout for the 50 to 60 Montecito divorced/married male set (they alternated between Lucky and Piatti and Montecito is so small it was very easy to identify a core group of regulars shuttling back and forth).

Lucky is so expensive and good but the young people (30s) who go there tend to be the most annoying SB 30-somethings, trying to prove they have vastly more money than they do. Then they post pictures on Facebook: ""I'm at Lucky!"" Not to be mean but it's always the most annoying, pretentious youngish people on SB Facebook who ""check-in"" at Lucky, passing themselves off as 50-somethings who have made it and can really afford to eat there (those people of course don't ""check in"" to say they're dropping X dollars on dinner that night) :) 

Don't get me wrong: Lucky is great (when someone else is paying) and the brunch is not that bad, depending upon how you drink (Mimosa or Bloody Mary). The best brunch in SB , hands down, for value and quality is Blush SB. 

This is not a prix fixe with bottomless kind of place. But Wine Bistro is a wonderful addition to the stable of farm-to-table restaurants in SB and I will be back for sure.

(P.S. Happy Hour is reportedly great. I have seen (and smelled) the sea bass and it looks scrumptious. The nice thing about WB is you can moderate spending. Pizzas are the bargain, fish the splurgy dishes. Pastas are moderate and the sides are tremendous and make a nice light, healthy meal.)",2012-11-03 00:08:40

The service was good but we were not thrilled with our food.  2 beers, a burger and a panini (Italian), and the bill $50.00.
Honestly, the beer was the best of all and it wasn't  even draught.  The fries with the burger were luke warm and not very tasty and the burger was cooked to my request but tough. I asked for yellow mustard, but they only had a creamy dijon.... too mayonaiseie for me.  My partner said his panini was just ok.  Not sure if we will go back, but perhaps. Looks like they get a lot of tourists so their business is probably geared towards them. The restaurant appeared clean and the server was nice but not fabulous.

I leave this review mainly in the hopes that the owner will see it and give it some consideration.

Let's start with the positive then, nicely decorated and the picnic benches on the covered patio are great for beautiful Santa Barbara weather.

The problems start by them not offering decaf. Not everyone can tolerate caffeine, especially in the afternoons. I've never ever been to a place that did not at least offer a decaf Americano. It feels like coffee snobbery. 

Also, they charge .75 cents extra for non-dairy milk. Given the extreme drought of California,  they should charge .75 cents for cows milk given that animal products, including their excretions, are so detrimental to the environment. I'd totally have supported them had they no surcharge for non-dairy milk. Even if you don't care about the environment, again, not everyone can tolerate dairy so don't penalize us. There's an amazing coffee house in Mammoth that does not charge extra for non dair milk and when I asked why, they said, they wanted their customers to get their coffee crafted the way they wanted without regard to price. Well done Black Velvet Coffee in Mammoth Lakes!

I actually had wanted to buy a $25 gift card as a thank you for a friend who is a coffee lover, but ended up getting it from Handlebar instead. Yes, they also irritatingly charge for non-dairy milk, but at least they offer decaf. I want Rebar to succeed so I hope they will take these comments into consideration. If so, I'll be delighted to update my review.",2016-04-25 02:02:52

My wife and I popped in to Cafe Ana and were immediately charmed by the tasteful decor and layout of the space. We assumed the food would be on the same level, but sadly, it was not! We ordered the chicken soup, the patty melt, and the tomato bisque soup, and I thought the patty melt and the bisque were decent. The chicken soup was subpar and we felt the included veggies were frozen veggies they just dropped in last minute. 

That all being said, it would've been okay if the meal was ~$20. But it was $36, and we thought it was ridiculously overpriced for what it was. I'm sure other patrons will feel the same way, and I don't think Cafe Ana will be successful with its dining offering if it does not adjust pricing very soon. There's no way to leave feeling like you got your money's worth. Either step up the food quality drastically, or reduce prices 30% or so.

It's a beautiful space with huge windows that lets in a ton of natural light. We stopped by for some small bites and wine before dinner and the next day for a huge breakfast. The food is delicious and there's something for everyone. I recommend you visit multiple times like we did to try everything. You won't regret it. We even bought two bottles of wine to take home with us. Best leftovers ever. ;),2019-02-10 06:56:33

Like any new spot, the first few months is spent iterating and refining. Too many customers feeling so entitled to cheap, delicious, perfect food. 

Small business are much more than just that. They're an effort to create something that didn't exist before for a segment of the market.

I think they've done just that. A cozy quaint spot that craftily manages to feel spacious and refreshing. Great coffee and pastries. Not sure about the food as we didn't get a chance to try.

Both Frances and Ryan have both been extremely kind, compassionate and helpful, no matter what is thrown their way. Last week Frances was waiting on a consistent flow of customers with grace, patience and ease. And today, since no one was in line behind me, Ryan offered to take the time to walk me step by step through the Panera app and show me how to preorder my coffees so that it saves me time on future visits. He was kind, considerate, and seemed happy to help me which made me feel like a valued customer. Thank you Panera for my free coffee.

Being L.A. locals, we have become accustomed to higher priced bistros. At first Pierre Lafond's seemed like suitable choice. But we are sadly disappointed. My lady ordered the steak entree and i ordered blackened chicken salad. The food portions were small which we somewhat expected from a french bistro. But after taking a few bites the steak which was ordered a medium was definitely rare and was almost cold in the center. The quality of meat was fatty and tough which was surprising being that it was one of the higher priced items on the menu. My salad seemed more like a curried chicken than a blackened chicken and it was so over powered by the feta cheese that it became too much to bare by the end of the dish. Both meals seemed thrown together in a fashion in which care and quality were completely abandoned. Our server seemed more interested in impressing ladies at the bar. To the point that we were pawned off on other servers and had to wait a quite bit of time to receive the check.

***

Update 7/12/13: This place has a recurring problem with a sewage smell that permeates the restaurant.  The last time I was there, I asked an employee about it, and he said they knew about the problem, it had something to do with the pipes that ran underneath the floor, and they were trying to figure out how to fix it.  If they can't figure it out, I think they need to do something more drastic.  Close the restaurant for a while and bring experts in to redo the entire piping/water/sewage system.  As it is, it's very unpleasant and likely unhealthy to go into the store and breathe the sewage smell.

Other nearby stores (Chipotle, See's, etc.) in the same building don't have this problem, so there's definitely something wrong with this store. 

***

I'm happy this Panera has finally opened.  My favorite sandwiches here are the Asiago Roast Beef and the Napa Almond Chicken Salad.  The french baguettes are really good.  The salads are good when the lettuce is fresh, but I have gotten not-so-fresh lettuce a time or two.  I also haven't found any soups or pastries to write home about.

The service at this location has gotten a lot better and faster since the opening days, but they still need to work more on making the orders accurately.  If you modify a sandwich by taking an ingredient or two out, they make it wrong half the time, often making the standard sandwich with no changes.  I've even ordered the standard sandwich with no changes and had them add an ingredient that wasn't supposed to be in there!  This can be easily fixed if you're eating in but not if you ordered take-out.  I often don't discover the mistake until much later, and then I'm stuck with it.",2012-04-26 17:17:03

I'm from the East coast and so it's very nostalgic for me to be able to walk into an establishment that I can count on to be the same here as it is back home. Today I had the Fuji apple salad and some hot broccoli and cheddar soup. The salad was fresh and loaded with nuts, blue cheese, chicken and dried apples. The soup was excellent, served in a sourdough bread bowl, baked perfectly. 
Pros: Air conditioned, fast and courteous service, clean tables and bathroom, lots of parking. Plentiful portions. Seasonal foods you can count on. Huge variety of breads and bagels. Mmm. 
Cons: Air conditioning is strong , so beware if you don't like it now that you're used to living in the central coast. Haha. The dishes served are tasty but not as creative as you would find at other local sandwich places.

And I don't say this lightly, because your girl LOVES Panera. I grew up on their Mac & Cheese and soup with one barely 2 minutes from my house. So it hurts my heart to diss Panera, but unfortunately the astounding incompetence that we experienced today has forced my hand. 

Buckle up y'all.

So we get there at 6 PM. Prime dinner time. I get it. When we walk in, there's an enormous line, which probably should have been our first clue that things were about to go awry. But we thought, it's fine, they probably all came around the same time as us anyways. As the line crept onwards, it occurred to me that things were happening a little slower than was normal for Panera, but the thought left me when we reached the cashier. I ordered a You Pick 2, a soup and a mac & cheese; two of my friends also ordered a You Pick 2 to share and a smoothie, and another friend ordered a chicken noodle soup. The cashier seemed nice enough (I had no idea what was coming, rest in peace). 

We were a party of six, so we sat at a big table in the middle of the Panera. It was then that I realized that we didn't have a number stand to put on the table, so I asked my friend to go back and get one for us. She disappeared for a rather long time, returning with teas for her parents, but no number. I asked her what had happened, and she told me that the cashier had said that they knew what number we were, and would deliver our food accordingly. Odd, but not criminalizing. I returned to socializing, only to be interrupted by a waitress asking us if a plate was our order. And then another. And another. 25 minutes in, and we had received none of our orders while being asked whether at least five were ours. I was flabbergasted. What did our cashier mean, they knew what number we were? Did they know any of the other numbers that were sitting on the other guests' tables??

Given that half an hour had passed, I went to the cashier to ask him to check on our order. He apologized, took our receipt, and then vanished. About ten minutes pass, and he's just gone. I see other workers walking back and forth, but nothing on our receipt. It isn't until I grab my friend and SHE flags him down again that he asks what's wrong. We ask him about our order, and he says it's coming. Tries to leave again. We demand our receipt, and he rummages about before finally returning it. Tries to leave AGAIN. I ask how long we have to wait for our orders, and he says 5-10 minutes. 

At last, our food arrives and, as the cashier (now our waiter) places the trays on our table, I have to try really hard not to laugh. My plate looks somewhat normal, but my friends' mac & cheese looks as if, no joke, someone had taken three small spoons of it and dumped it onto just the left side of their plate. When I try my food, it's barely lukewarm. Granted, I love my food piping hot and consider many restaurant-plated foods cold, but this was actually cold. My soup had been heated like La Croix, as if the chef had very gently whispered HOT next to my room-temperature meal. But I was too hungry to care, so I ate. 

It wasn't until I was halfway done that I noticed that my other friend still hadn't gotten her soup. So, once again, I flagged down the waiter. It takes a few tries to get him to understand my request and then he tells us that the chicken noodle soup has run out. Surprise!!!! As if this wasn't something to bring to our attention earlier, the 3-4 times that we've already spoke with him. I'm absolutely furious, but I hold it in. He asks us, after a very long pause, whether we'd like a refund, and my friend spits, ""Of course! And I'd also like my smoothie."" 

In the end, we finally got our smoothie, my friends got Chipotle to make up for their poor food turnout, and my friend's mom went to argue for our refund (which the waiter didn't put through, apparently). Once again, we waited at least 20 minutes before we were able to get the refund and a $15 certificate in apology. My friend's mom also said, although this is hearsay, that she could see the manager just hanging out behind a counter, refusing to handle her case until 15 minutes had passed. When we finally left, it was almost 7:30, and my friend and I were late to a get together we'd planned earlier in the week. 

I understand that we got compensation, and that this review may seem petty, but I'm still livid and want others to at least know that something like this can happen at this location. I'm never coming back ever again. I'll get my mac & cheese at a more competent Panera, thanks.",2019-03-03 09:04:03

I have not been to Panera back east. I assumed people who have, come to ours because it is familiar and reminds them of another place. 

Maybe the Paneras back east are different. A few people have implied as much. 

Drinks and pastries are about the same quality as a Starbucks. Not bad. Some nice enough. But not great. (Realize, this city is full of Peet's and CB&TL, plus awesome independent pastry shops and cafés, boasting top notch sweets and java.)

So, think quality like Starbucks...but will be crowded and no super perky staff, and you will sit at a sort of Denny's style table or booth in a very well lit but bland atmosphere. 

Food matches the atmosphere. Not bad at all, but just ok. In fact, if Starbucks did serve meals, I think they might be like this. 

Why go here? Well... it is in a very popular shopping center so you might want to get some coffee during your day. The center has lots of parking, and you can grab lunch with coffee. 

The Starbucks in this center is tiny, very limited seating, whereas  Panera is large and you likely will be able to sit right away. It is family friendly if you have kids. 

They have a loyal following. I have been there a few times because friends wanted to go. Staff was pleasant though busy, as there is a huge volume of people to serve.

Three stars because it is clean and consistent. And nothing really bad about it.

Cafe Ana is a really cute place with a wonderfully designed interior. We went in on a Saturday for brunch, so it was a bit crowded. It was kind of confusing when you first walk in. They have a counter to order at with menus but you can only order food at the tables and there was a wait for the food tables but plenty of seating elsewhere. One side of the cafe is just for coffee and drinks, the other side is for sit down food. Kitchen is small so I think they weren't able to keep up with the amount of people coming in. We counted 40 empty seats as we were sitting there waiting to be seated to order food and there were plenty of seats in the ""coffee and drinks"" section but they wouldn't let us order food there. A sign might help with that confusion like ""please wait to be seated"" or something. It ended up taking an hour for us to get seated. The wait for our food wasn't terrible but still about 20-30 min. So it took us an hour and half from the time we walked in to the time we saw a plate of food. We were starving. 

Speaking of food, it was okay. I ordered the prosciutto and egg sandwich and then they told me they ran out of prosciutto but could substitute sausage. The flavor of the sausage was very overpowering and clashed with the aioli. My fiancé got the salmon scramble and said it was ok but that he was too hungry to really tell. We ordered the bakery basket and that actually had some really good bread and biscuits. Definitely recommend trying the cheddar chive biscuit. 

 Despite the long wait and everything, everyone that works there was super nice! They just need a new system. Long term this system or small kitchen won't work. You have people coming in seeing a bunch of empty tables but being told there is a 30 minute wait to be seated, that looks terrible.

I really wanted to give them 4-5 stars however a few days after writing the above review, they completely changed their breakfast menu. Theyve now downgraded their breakie sandwiches in terms of portion and no longer offer any of the original sandwiches. They've basically stripped out ingredients AND increased the price by a whopping $5!!!  The Avocado is now not included (which was why I loved this sandwich so much) So I'm paying more for less? Ordering the same sandwich I was used to getting costs nearly $15 vs $10! That's just bacon and eggs, folks! Feels really off. Not sure if you think paying $15 for an egg sandwich with some bacon or ham is worth it - But this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. Pretty disappointing!!",2020-02-13 06:35:25

fjgzmrl9qnUUp1f3gzeTlg,aA8mBdQBJLFFUMDiLauRGA,cQDwJjslebJv5Co7gCm2Yw,1,3,1,0,I work close by and I have tried giving this place a chance. They're horrible. I came in opening week and ordered a soup (which wasn't marked on the menu properly and was twice as expensive as stated). The soup had absolutely no flavor and the chicken in it was undercooked. I realize that chicken can be darker depending on what part of the body the chicken is from. Well this wasn't dark chicken it was actually bloody. I got food poisoning from the amount of it that I choked down before realizing it wasn't cooked through. Then I tried to email the staff and just let them know what happened to avoid this review. Well they emailed me back and told me I was wrong. So here I am writing this review. I highly recommend walking a block or two extra and finding a place with better food and better service. I will never give this Cafe my business again.,2019-01-24 15:54:37

We went here since we felt we couldn't leave Santa Barbara without having a cheese plate to go with our wine.  Unfortunately, this was the one item our server forgot to bring us from our order...He asked us if we still wanted it after bringing our main courses, and we said yes.  It was very tasty when we finally got it, but we thought we deserved some sort of consolation prize for the mis-hap (perhaps waiving the charge of the cheese plate, or even an apology?) Other than that, the food was ok, I wouldn't order the roasted red pepper flat-bread again as it was pretty bland.  Good beet salad and wine selection.",2010-02-18 02:37:14

While this is definitely not an in-and-out type fast food stop and you may have to wait a little bit to get your food it is DEFINITELY worth it!

It really is a repeating bite of ecstasy. It also pairs perfectly with a double shot latte! 

I was also recently was informed on their absurdly inexpensive pints! $5 for a Common Lemon Cider Pint? Rock on! They also have a delicious Honey Hips Blonde that is 8.2 %. Tastes light but gives off a great buzz - How can you complain!

To me, Paneras are a cold weather kinda place - you know, the spot you go to warm yourself up in a cozy atmosphere with a savory bowl of soup. For some reason, their Broccoli Cheddar soup always seems to put a smile on my face. There have never been exceptions to this. 

This particular location is adjacent to a popular mall with ample parking. The restaurant itself is spacious, but not always the cleanest. However, it's never felt dirty to the point of me not wanting to eat there. I'm usually able to cozy up in a comfy booth with my number as I wait for my order to be delivered. 

The service and food are on par with other Panera locations: not the greatest but enjoyable enough. I like ordering the ""Pick 2"" deal where I can get a half sandwich plus a bowl of soup. The food has always been satisfactory to me and really does hit the spot on a cold winter day.

It's fun to try the different things they offer on tap like cold brew, kombucha, cereal milk (looool). Expect to pay for the quality and experience so you're running up about 4.50 for a cold brew. They offer food and pastries and it's a nice and fancy place to stop by for a quick snack. I've tried their $5 truffle fries. Satisfying size for two people and guess what? They're curly fries. 

I don't know if you've ever had a munchie run for jack in the box curly fries and ended up with a few straight cut fries in the paper. It's a real satisfying experience. Rebar offers the amped up version. Found one straight cut fry and a massive potato wedge in my curly fries that I guessed was a garnish? I was so excited.

Rebar serves delicious drip coffee, lattes, and cold brew. They have an assortment of bottled, cold beverages, as well as, local beer and wine. They also offer fresh squeezed orange and tomato juices. 

On a hot day, I usually opt for the cold brew. It is rich, bold and tasty! When I'm looking to warm up, I tend to order an Almond Milk Latte - sooo good! Or an Almond Milk Vanilla Latte, made with a touch of their house made Vanilla Bean Syrup. I am so delighted that they make their syrups in house rather than using the ordinary Torani brand syrups. 

Rebar offers breakfast daily, fresh baked pastries and lunch items including massive, gourmet burgers with fries, pizzas and salads. 

I've had the Sticky Bun multiple times and it is the dessert sweet dreams are made of! Imagine a cinnamon bun but better, doughy on the inside, crispy, perfectly caramelized crust on the outside, topped with candied nuts and a sauce that trickles down the outside ridges of the crust, mmmm good! 

I also highly recommend the Ricotta toast which consists of an extra thick slice of fresh baked bread, topped with a generous slather of hand pulled ricotta cheese and finished off with a layer of jam of your choice (Blueberry Strawberry, Strawberry Rhubarb, Peach or Honey). I had it with Strawberry Rhubarb and it was fantastic! Not too sweet and very filling. It could be a light meal on it's own or order one to share as a little amuse bouche for your table. 

The Avocado Bacon & Egg Sandwich is definitely worth a mention as well. House made Brioche bun, baked to golden perfection, sandwiching a fried egg over medium, several slices of thick, smokey bacon, smashed fresh avocado and topped with diced chives. The sandwich comes with a Chipotle Ketchup that I've heard is wonderful, however, I love a combination of sweet and savory for breakfast so I substitute the ketchup for house made jam, usually Strawberry Rhubarb. It's heavenly! If you've ever had the breakfast sandwich at Renaud's, this is reminiscent of that (only slightly different ingredients), and served with a much better bread in my opinion, because the brioche does not tear up my gums like the bread at Renaud's does. Just try it, it's worth it!

It would not be a complete review without mentioning the ambiance, decor, location and music. Rebar feels like a respite from the hustle and bustle of State Street, even though it's located right on it. Walking into Rebar is like stepping back in time to the Prohibition-Era. Natural wood, metal and steel accents, the greatest jazz humming through unseen speakers and beautiful large windows to people watch. 

There is also a huge, dog friendly outdoor patio with plenty of picnic tables. They'll even bring a water bowl for your pooch(es). I know because I've brought my two loves. ;) 

The staff is warm and friendly. They all seem very well-trained. There is free wifi, password: 214union. 

Parking is easy in their lot adjacent to Rebar, or if necessary, you can park across the street in the Amtrak lot where the first 75 mins are free.

The only note I have of constructive feedback is regarding the bathrooms, which are located next to the patio and across from the kitchen doors. They are often dirty and need regular attention. I suggest having an hourly or bi-hourly schedule for the staff to check the bathrooms and do any clean up necessary. It is very off putting when a bathroom is in disgusting condition at a restaurant because it gives off a vibe of uncleanliness. Something I would not associated with my restaurant if I owned one. Other than that, I'd say Rebar is close to perfect for a little cafe.",2015-10-25 18:06:48

I was extremely disappointed by this concha. The pink sugar topping was done right, but the bun was basically a wheat roll. That is NOT my idea of a concha.

After breakfast, I went to the bathroom with my wallet and accidentally left my wallet in the restaurant after I finished up the breakfast.

I looked around in both bathrooms, under the toilet, inside the trashcan, and checked every inch of both bathrooms (even though I knew EXACTLY which bathroom I used). I walked around the block, to see if someone just stole the cash and chucked the wallet outside, so I circled the block 2 times. At that point, I walked home (since I live fairly close) and filed a police report, and froze my cards. After doing that, I came back to search around more, talked to the staff and gave them my contact information, and told them I filed a police report just to be transparent with them. 20 MIN LATER I GET A CALL FROM THEM.

This location is housed in the Santa Barbara Public Market. If you chose to park in their lot it is $5 minimum. Ummm no thanks! We drove around and found street parking. Enjoy Cupcakes is located to your right when you walk in - I believe they were the second vendor on the left side of the walkway. 

They change their flavors weekly. The flight is six mini cupcakes served to you in a cute egg crate. We bought two of them, one for us, one for his brother who was watching our house while we were out of town. $20 even for the two flights, in and out in less than 2 minutes!

The flavors we got were:

Chocolate Blackberry Syrah (Signature Flavor) - Chocolate syrah cake, filled with dark chocolate fudge, topped with blackberry frosting and a syrah soaked blackberry that's rolled in sugar crystals

Blueberry Lemon Lavender Chardonnay - Chardonnay cake, filled with lemon lavender infused curd, topped with blueberry frosting 

Ridiculous - Chocolate cake, filled with salted caramel, topped with peanut butter frosting, chocolate sauce, more salted caramel 

Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - Vanilla cake, with a creme brulee filling, topped with vanilla bean frosting & caramelized sugar pieces

Mint Chocolate Chip - Chocolate cake, filled with mint fudge, topped with mint chocolate chip frosting

The Caribbean - Vanilla cake, filled with pineapple banana, rum jam, topped with coconut cream frosting

We found the vanilla cupcakes to be more moist and flavorful than the chocolate ones. Hands down absolute favorite for both of us was the Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee - I would eat that all the time if I could! I think the Blueberry Lemon Lavender Chardonnay was my second favorite. 

If you like cupcakes, pick up a flight. It was worth the stop for us.",2015-08-07 16:09:41

I was enjoying some more wine at a local late-night bar with my girlfriends and two of us (myself and my friend Jenn) were craving something sweet, like cake. So our fabulous foodie friend Lorrie all of a sudden tells us, ""Hold on, I'll be right back!"" And runs off into the night. We sat there at the bar somewhat confused, but shrugged and continued to chat it up with the lovely bartenders.

About 15 min later, Lorrie returns with a cute little egg carton. We opened it up like it was Christmas morning and voila 6 cute little cupcakes of all sorts sat in this carton. I tried at least 3 flavors and loved them all but my fave has to be their Signature Chocolate Blackberry Syrah which was chocolate syrah cake, filled with dark chocolate fudge, topped with blackberry frosting and a syrah soaked blackberry that's rolled in sugar crystals. Talk about a wineo and sweet tooth lover's dream!

We actually came back to this cute little spot the next day as we were exploring SB Public Market and took a few foodporn photos. I'm mad at myself for not buying some cupcakes for myself or at least one of their delicious chocolate chip cookies they had near the cash register. 

If you're a huge cupcake fan, THIS is the place to have them in SB!

I tried the cupcake flight, which was an aesthetic/tastebud delight. 6 mini cupcakes are boxed in a half-dozen egg carton. How creative and cool is that? I shared this with a friend, so each of us got literally 3 bites worth of cupcake. But each bite was so good! Every cupcake was super sweet but not overwhelmingly so (maybe because we didn't have that much of it). Each cupcake also had their own distinct flavor as well, and in addition to delicately pipped frosting on top, there was also a bit of a filling. I particularly enjoyed the chocolate blackberry syrah cupcake. The fruity flavor, while sweet, helped tone down the heaviness of everything else. The blueberry blood orange chardonnay was also really nice. It reminds me of a tart, lemon flavored cupcake, but wayyyy better.

I admit cupcakes are my favorite food group.  I consider my self a connoisseur... And don't hesitate to throw out calories that are mediocre.  

Once we relocated to California last summer, I was determined to road trip and experience these cuppies first hand.  I was driving an hour and 40 minutes to the Los Olivos location until this new spot opened... Cut 40 minutes from my drive!  Yay!

It is probably a good thing they aren't closer to me because I would have no self control and be indulging in every weekly flight.

If you do want to get cupcake wasted, their term for ""flight"" means one of each mini cupcake, not one of each wine taster, silly (they don't even sell wine here).

A friend of mine was ranting about this place so I've been meaning to try it out. I had no idea while I was only walking into SBPM for the artisanal ice cream, this place is literally right across it!

Verdict: Why not make them regular sized cupcakes at the bakery?! My tastebuds wanted more than a mini, but I guess that's a good thing. That's why I opted for the ""flight."" Cute egg crates just for a pack of 6 ($10). I bought another one for my friend who recommended this place only to give it as a thank you gift. I can't seem to describe all these cupcakes (Cookies & Cream, Raspberry Pineapple Lemon Chardonnay, Triple Chocolate mousse, Peanut Butter Cheesecake, Chocolate Blackberry Syrah, & Sugar Daddy) separately, but the way these are made definitely well worth the title, ""Enjoy."" My favorite is the Chocolate Blackberry Syrah, a quite surprising Syrah taste before & after.

Additional menu options: cake puddings, cakes, mousse cups, & drinks

They also do preorders for special occasions as well. I'd definitely recommend them!

*If you do want regular sized cupcakes, you must do a special order by the dozen only ($36) with a 24 hour notice.

Despite the name I fell in love with the double stuffed cookies and never tried the cupcakes. Found this place on Yelp and knew I had to try it because of the amazing ratings and boy did it not disappoint. In fact, it was better than I ever could've expected. On my 1st trip here I got the double stuffed cookie with cookie dough and chocolate gnache. Choosing just 1 cookie was tough but I knew it was a good choice. When the cashier handed me the cookie I couldn't believe how heavy the cookie was. I love dessert though so this pumped me up! 

My 1st bite of this cookie was divine and every bite after I loved just as much as the 1st. Each cookie was so soft and chewy, and the inside cookie dough was amazing. The chocolate gnache was just 1 extra treat that sent this cookie over the top. Even though it was big I had no problems finishing it and was immediately in love. I even think it might be the best cookie I have ever eaten!!! 

Since I was just visiting Santa Barbara I knew I had to get another one of these - so the next day my friend and I split the one with icing stuffing and it was so great too. Not quite as good as the cookie dough but a very close 2nd. And just to make sure we got our fair share of these cookies we bought 1 more cookie dough stuffed one to go for the next day! Call us big fatties but it was vacation and these cookies couldn't be passed up!!!

I feel bad because with the flavor choices they boast (you should see their website for a full listing), I really, really wanted to like these...... and I didn't.  I read every single review, and I thought I was going to swoon over these little cupcakes, but I didn't.    :-(

First of all, I found them inside a place called the Santa Barbara Public Market, and I loved the ambience of that place (see separate review for that), but when I stumbled onto the area where Enjoy Cupcakes is located, I almost walked right by.  I was looking for a bunch of cupcakes.  What I found was a small counter with 4 glass containers with about a dozen of whatever flavors were in them.  They were offering 6, as they only do each day.......  and not all 6 were even out.  Just 4.  If you wanted all six, they were in a small carton.  I was stuck on the fact that there were only 6 flavors for the day, and I asked.... that is all they ever offer.  (Remember that scene in A Fish Called Wanda where Kevin Kline's character opens the safe in the garage and does NOT see the diamonds, and he yells out, ""Disappoinnnnnntedddddddddd"" ???  That's how I felt.)

Their website claims the following........""590 Cupcake flavors to date, while continually experimenting & adding more.""  Then, they list the flavors, and while I haven't counted them, I have no idea if it shows 590 flavors, but it's one amazingly long list.  So, I wasn't expecting 590 flavors.... but certainly about 20.  All I got was 6, and at that, I felt like the whole thing was just too controlled and fixed.  They were so small that I wasn't going to leave without the 6 offered, but I definitely left there feeling cheated.  They offered some refrigerated pudding (2 choices of that), but I wasn't going home right away and didn't want that sitting in the car.

So we get home, split the 6 cupcakes in 1/2, which is difficult to do with such small cupcakes, but we do it...... and that way, both my husband and I can share.  I didn't even finish mine.  I didn't like the texture...... cake a bit too heavy for my liking, and I didn't like the icing.  I just wasn't tasting the flavors, and on one of them, perhaps it was the cupcake with the syrah wine, ewwwwwwwwww, that just tasted bad to me.  The others, nothing special, and with the titles they were given, I expected powerhouse flavors going on.  Didn't happen.

I gave 2 stars out of guilt..... being the only one thus far to speak ill of them.  I just didn't want to be too harsh.  I've tried many cupcakes in my time, and these just didn't rate.  Sorry.",2014-07-13 08:04:02

I didn't see the appeal, cupcakes as they were made at sprinkles were practically a meal in and of themselves. Though they had interesting sounding flavors, they were oftentimes so sickly sweet you couldn't more than one or two bites before you felt sugared-out.

Flash forward to the opening of the public market and man, has my view of cupcakes been changed! I loved every flavor of the flight, with favorites being the lemon lavender Chardonnay (which I mistakenly thought at first was an actual glass of lemon lavender Chardonnay to go with the cupcakes HAHA.

What I love about these cupcakes is the size, intricacy and uniqueness of each cupcake in the flight. It was a delight to look at, but even more of a delight to eat them. Moist, with a delicious cream in the middle that leaves you feeling surprised that it's so good. 

I took my flight in the cute little egg carton that they package the cupcakes in to go urban wine tasting and had many people ask me where I had gotten all those lovely looking cupcakes from. They must have had the drunchies for some awesome cupcakes! Can't wait to try their other flavors :)",2014-05-11 18:10:33

My husband and I live in Los Angeles but got married in Santa Barbara, and we wanted to have an original, delicious wedding cake that was over-the-top in *flavor* rather than looks.  We called the Public Market location and set up a time to come in and taste the weekly cupcake flavors.  The owner, Amber, can do ANY of her cupcake flavors as a cake!  The cupcakes are so moist, fresh, and amazing- and the toppings and flavor combinations make you feel like you are in a 5-star restaurant that specializes on cupcakes rather than entrees.  Just ridiculous.  What's more- Amber sent us the list of over 800 flavor combos for us to choose from for our wedding cake!  We ended up ordering a two-tier chocolate cake with brown butter cookie dough, toffee sauce, and vanilla icing.  Our guests were blown away, and even at our own cake cutting at the wedding I had a moment of ""wow that is SO good"" after my husband fed it to me, and I had to mentally re-focus on the moment of what I was supposed to be doing as the bride!  The cake was incredibly reasonably priced - much less than we would have paid at any bakery or wedding bakery, and without a doubt more tasty!!!  Any time we are in the Santa Barbara area, we will come by to pick up some cupcakes.  And even better, when we go wine tasting we will hit up Sarloos & Sons to do the cupcake pairing with the wine tasting (and they have a photo booth!).  Amber has it figured out.

I asked her if the filling in the cookie was ice cream and her response was ""if it was ice cream it would have already melted"" with a really rude tone, and didn't even bother to tell me what the filling was, l thought it was a legit question, she must really hate her job. Regardless, I still got the cookie sandwich because I'm all about supporting local businesses but I strongly encourage the owner (maybe she was the owner?) to educate their employees on good customer service.

As a bride who loves dessert, I was picky when it came to our wedding cake. Wedding cake has a bad reputation: it's often dry, too sweet, or stale. I was determined to go beyond the status quo and get a delicious wedding cake. I heard great things about Enjoy and decided to use them for our wedding day in Santa Barbara on 10.19.19. Such a great decision! We got a three-tier raspberry creme brûlée wedding cake and not only was it beautiful, but it was the most delicious cake I've ever had (and I've had a lot of cake). I couldn't help myself and ate some for breakfast the next day, that's how good it was! Enjoy's cakes have it all: they are elegant, have tons of unique flavor options, the best texture, smooth frosting, and most importantly they are not too sweet, just the perfect amount of sweet. We also ordered their blackberry Syrah cupcakes and chocolate chip and snickerdoodle cookies. Several days later, guests are still raving about the desserts!

Located inside the Public Market, a multi variety marketplace full of locally owned businesses, Green Star is not a cafe like setting. You will have to park in the underground garage or on the street. They do have a couple chairs on the side of the bar and tables located throughout the market that their wifi somewhat reaches over to. The layout is definitely designed for grab and go style coffee ordering.

The staff have never been significantly friendly in my experiences though they did give me a cup of hot water one day when it was very cold out for no charge. It just hasn't ever felt like a personable coffee ordering experience. They don't have too many options for coffee drinks though they do have a nice variety of loose leaf teas.

The coffee is Organic and they sell it by the bag. I've had a couple different lattes there, black coffee and iced and none of them did it for me. The roasts don't seem to blend well with milks and the coffee itself really just tastes burnt and extremely watered down to me.

No, I did not win the lotto (I'm still broke).
No, I did not get a much deserved promotion at work (bastards).
No, I did not get married (that dark day came two years later).

What happened was I ate my very first cupcake from Enjoy Cupcakes, the best damn cupcakes on planet earth! After just one bite I knew I was gonna be hooked for life. Enjoy transformed me into the cupcake lover I am today.  

Since that first encounter I've made the long trek from LA to Los Olivos dozens of times just to stuff my pie hole with their scrumptious cuppies. Every time I go, I swear that their cupcakes taste as good or better than the time before. Their cupcakes are the most creative, moist, flavorful I've ever tried, and I've been around the cupcake block a few times, hence the nickname CupcakeCraig. And because they have like a million flavors (550+, but who's counting) I've rarely had the same flavor twice (menu changes weekly). However, they do have a signature flavor that's offered everyday, which is their Chocolate Blackberry Syrah cupcake. Trust me when I say it's as sinfully delicious as it sounds. It's become my all time favorite cupcake. 

Now, fast forward five years to the present, right as Enjoy Cupcakes is celebrating their fifth year anniversary (proud to say I've been a supporter from practically the start), they debut their second location inside of the brand new Santa Barbara Public Market. I love everything about their cute new shop. From the awesome whisk light fixtures, to the cool pick up window and the wooden menu board, everything is absolutely adorable and perfect. 

And the cupcakes, you ask? They're just as good or better than the time before!  

But what I love the most about Enjoy Cupcakes is how the owners and employees of the company have befriended me and treated me like family. Every time I pay the shop a visit I end up chit chatting with Kevin (the face of Enjoy) about food, family and just about anything and everything under the sun. And it's not just Kevin, either. His wife Amber (the Jedi baker) is a total sweetheart,  whose passion and love for baking is evident every time I eat one of their cupcakes. And the ultra talented bakers, Kara and Amber, are two of the raddest girls I've ever met who I keep in contact with via Instagram. All of the great people I just mentioned make me feel like I'm part of the Enjoy family, which is something I cherish.  

Those are the reasons why Enjoy changed my life for the better. They not only opened my eyes on how awesomely delicious and complex cupcakes really are, but they also taught me the importance of being passionate about your craft and also how hard work and dedication pays off. Now that they have a shop in a large city, I'm positive they're gonna be super famous. Their original location has a cult like following, and it's located in a tiny city with a population of less than 2,000 people. Very soon they're going to take over the cupcake scene in Central Cali... Then the world!

I'm so happy for my friends at Enjoy Cupcakes. They deserve all the success that they've earned. I know everyone who eats one of their cupcakes while visiting the Public Market will love them as much as I do.

I started with the eggless cookie dough ball dipped in chocolate. Wow, this was fabulous and goes perfectly with a morning coffee.

Blackberry was good! I liked this because the alcohol flavor wasn't overpowering. It was also hiding a sweet spot of chocolate buttercream and mmmm...perfection! Sweet and smooth but not lard. Same with apple cran, very tasty! Cakes are moist enough and not overly sweet which is nice. You can tell they are freshly made.

Pretzel cupcake was very tasty as well. Had a center of caramel.

We got 2 of each of the remaining flavors, Ginger Tangerine Chardonnay
 and Chocolate Blackberry Syrah. The inclusion of wine was really inventive and worked well. The chardonnay cake had a ginger curd and tangerine buttercream, with a little bit of tang and light sweetness. The cake itself was a nice texture too, light and fluffy.

The chocolate syrah was the better of the two for me - slightly heavier cake base with dark chocolate fudge filling, then topped with frosting. The frosting also had sugar crystals on top which gave it a surprising little bit of a bite.

I liked the egg box as packaging - which helped the last two cakes survive the trip home in my handbag, even after falling over. Impressive.

I wish I could've tried a full flight. Best to get there a little before closing time if you want to try them all.",2019-03-25 22:55:47

I run a nonprofit called the Green Stars Project so I was super-excited to see a place called Green Star Coffee listed in Santa Barbara. My project is all about ethical consumerism, so I went there with a little trepidation, hoping that it would not be the kind of place that serves commodity coffee in Styrofoam cups. Thankfully, I had no cause for concern - they live up to their name :-) More on that in the next paragraph... Overall, I tried coffee in several places in SB - Green Star, Handlebar, Helena Avenue Bakery, and the SB Roasting Co. Of the four of them, I thought Green Star had the best overall experience when you combine quality/experience with sustainability/ethics. I had a small Americano - pretty decent at $2.50, considering it contains two shots of organic, fair trade coffee. Nice Americano: not too weak (thanks to the two shots) and nicely roasted (not over-roasted). The barista was super-friendly. Nice seating area outside the public market. 

I'm also giving Green Star Coffee 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* All of their beans are certified organic and Fair Trade. Most of it is also shade-grown (impt for habitats). 
* I read that one of their suppliers, a coffee farm in Guatemala, was affected by coffee leaf rust. Green Star agreed to pay them higher prices to get them over the difficult patch. They seem like genuinely good guys. 
* It's one of the few places I've come across lately that uses compostable cups. You know regular cups have a plastic lining, right? The vast majority of conventional cups end up in landfill because there's nothing else to do with them. Green Star's hot cup lids and cold cups are also compostable.
* Their milk, sugar and agave are all organic. Plant-based milks available too, naturally. 
* They are a zero-landfill café. They re-use their own coffee bags and everything else is recyclable or compostable.

After being handed the cupcakes, I asked if they had little cards to note the flavors for presentation - ""no, we are all out, they are all online"" rather than offering to note them or to provide a piece of paper. It was within the first twenty minutes of opening, so these are not regularly supplied.

I asked if they have anything to help present for a birthday, and he pulled out a single small candle and said it is all they do and that I could go to CVS. 

After ordering the two sets I got an extra cupcake for myself, which was charged at full rate as if purchasing a single cupcake only. Not so concerned about the small savings for bulking bulk but curious about the principle of that, I asked why the rate isn't congruent with the discount I received for ordering two sets if I got an extra one - ""no one has ever complained about that"". Four for cupcakes and zero for customer service. 

Be advised to not stop in there if you are looking to pick up a simple, minimally tailored gift for a birthday without notifying the day/s before - they are not prepared to provide any options like one would reasonably expect a cake shop to have. Even so, that would have been fine, but the disinterest, lack of any effort and creativity to pose an idea or offer to provide a note of the flavors or pull out a marker to write a birthday message on the box by the staff was very off-putting.",2019-07-22 19:40:48

Equally delicious are the cookie sandwiches. Picture two slightly under baked, soft, gooey chocolate chip cookies sandwiching a large dollop of vanilla icing. Yum, yum, yum!!

From the Chocolate Malt sprinkled with tiny bits of In 'n Out fries to Chardonnay and the Neapolitan, the flavors can never go wrong. The problem with many cupcakes is that they're too dry and they crumble at the touch. But Enjoy Cupcakes are always perfectly baked and the gooey fillings on the inside keep it moist and scrumptious.

Throughout our meal, the (small) restaurant was never more than maybe 40% full, and I counted 4-5 servers on staff. Nonetheless, we repeatedly had to go out of our way to track down a server to place orders or get coffee refills. We actually wound up placing a follow-up order with the busser.

The food was okay; nothing to write home about. The coffee was crappy, and the waitress wouldn't even fill the (small) mugs most of the way. Service was generally gruff, slow, and not terribly competent. The waitress actually dissuaded me from ordering a side, telling me that the item I wanted was part of the dish, even though it wasn't mentioned on the menu. Of course, when the food arrived, the item was nowhere to be seen, and our waitress didn't make another appearance for a half hour or so.

The service was slow even though it was not crowded when I got there.  The food was bland. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to make it work. I got a few pieces of heavily oiled carrots and couples slices of tomatoes for vegetables. The cost of the meal $35.00 (that included a glass of wine). I think it wasn't worth it.

But couldn't get to Santa  Barbara until, June 20, 2014.  After walking up and down State St. We came upon this quaint little bistro.  It was a
very, clear day but very humid.  We decided to sit out on the patio.  We  ordered white wine and an appetizer of Irish Soda bread with Irish cheese.

I normally don't like Irish Soda bread...but this was amazing!  The best, I've ever had. Very light, not too dense.  With the perfect amount of Irish cheese.

We were still a couple hours away from going to dinner, so we ordered a cheese plate, with French bread, cheese, nuts and fruit!  Again, so delicious.

Wine was served in nice glasses without the ""lip"".. Very classy.  My parents are from Eastern Europe and drinking from a fine wine glass is hard to come by.  You can always tell, when it's European glass...thin and delicate.

The Service! So, incredibly friendly and sincere.  Our waitress....such a sweet girl!!!! Always making sure, we were taken care of.  At one point the owner, with a nice Irish accent came out, and talked with us for a good 10-15 minutes.  It's the European hospitality, that I'm so familiar with. It's something that can't be taught...it's inherited.  Making you feel at home and completely comfortable.

Lastly, I live literally 33 minutes from this place...and my husband and I have decided to make this a regular stop! Knowing we will be warmly greeted, and enjoy, great food, service and an amazing ambiance!  Can't wait for the next visit.",2014-07-25 06:38:49

For the food: The empanadas are freshly baked and delicious whether it's gourmet or the classic. The gourmet is flaky and filled with about the same amount as the classic, while the classic has the standard bread and has more air in it. Regardless, both are light and flavorful and there isn't a wrong choice. I had the beef gourmet and the chicken classic, and but I'll definitely be back for more.

The location is great, the food was good, service was awful.

We were seated outside right away, but it took more than 5 minutes for our server to come over. (I think it was at least 10 but since I wasn't timing it I don't want to possibly exaggerate.) It was long enough for us to decide on what we were eating and read enough Yelp reviews that we started to consider leaving. (Should have checked Yelp before, like I usually do!)

The waitress came over apologizing. We ordered a soy mocha, a grilled chicken sandwich and the crab quesadilla.

The mocha came out and it tasted like chocolate flavored water. Really gross. I wanted to trade it in for an Iced Tea. We kept looking for our server and she was nowhere to be found. There were only a few tables and it was right during the lunch hour, which should have been our clue that this was a place to avoid. There were employees everywhere but not our server. I finally asked another employee if she could send our server over.

And we waited some more. We were actually deciding to leave when our food came out. So we started eating. My grilled chicken sandwich was good, the fries were good but greasy. My husband thought his crab quesadilla tasted like tuna.

We were almost done with our food when our server finally decided to grace us with her presence. I told her to please take off the barely touched mocha and to just bring the check, which she did.

There's no reason the service should have been that bad, they were not understaffed. There is a reason they were so empty during the Friday lunch hour, and management should take note.

Being that it is New Years, I had to settle on trying out La Arcada Bistro for the first time. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a mistake. My girlfriend and I are not hard to please by any means, but this place just did all they could to dissatisfy us. 

I would not recommend this spot to anyone. And, I will not return. There are just too many great places in Santa Barbara. Read on to hear how my experience went, if you are interested. 

First off, when I try a new place, I definitely go into it with an open mind, but there are a few things I expect from any restaurant as basic give-ins. My philosophy is simple. I go by the three strike rule. Service, food quality, over-all feeling. If the place gets three strikes, then that is it. I mean, I get that there are times when you have an ""off"" experience, but if the place strikes out, then there is something wrong at the core of the business. (In my opinion.)

La Arcada Bistro struck out. The service was poor (one example- I had to ask three different people over a 10 minute period of time for more [over-priced, barely warm, poor quality] coffee. This is a basic part of the service one pays for when going out to eat, and an easy one at that. If the server is trying hard, might be busy, the place could be understaffed, and I get that. However, this was not the case here. It came down to laziness, lack of attentiveness, and just plain disregard for a basic skill. Yes- basic. I have served in many atmospheres in the restaurant industry. I speak from experience. Refilling beverages is simple, and any service-oriented business should be proficient at the easy basic things.) Strike two was the poor quality of food, especially related to the prices. Breakfast is one of the easiest meals to prepare. If you are charging $10 for pancakes, they should be special in some way. I got two small pancakes that had less flavor than the cardboard that the box of mix they undoubtedly used came in. Strike three, overall feeling, came when my girlfriend found some hair in her lack-luster french toast breakfast. I asked the server if this was typical of their food, and when she assured me it wasn't I told her that my girlfriend had lost her appetite. The server offered no apologies and did not attempt to rectify the situation. This as I am sure you all know, is a major service blunder. Not only did the server reflect poorly on her own skills, but more importantly, the business itself. Needless to say, I will not recommend this place to anyone, and will on the contrary steer anyone who asks away from this business. I am a very reasonable consumer, but three strikes and I am done. I won't be surprised if La Arcada Bistro is out of business before the Spring. 

I am a solution oriented person, so if you are looking for a good place to have breakfast and find yourself near this one, there are several right there that are far better: The Andersen, Jeannine's, and State & Fig are three places in La Arcada that blow the ""Bistro"" out of the water. Do yourself a favor and try one of them instead.",2013-01-01 23:45:33

It was New Year's Eve before our symphony and we had to find a place to eat. We waited longer then we should have and ended up here because we just kept walking toward The Granada Theater. 

They had outside seating available and a NYE prefix menu that looked promising. 

They had lobster tail or prime rib so we were going to get both and share... We were seated and found out that they ran out of lobster tail... No big deal, we just both ordered the prime rib prefix dinner. We told them we had to leave by 8 and let them know that we only had 45 minutes to dine.

They brought our wines first, and they poured me the wrong one. We informed him and about 15 minutes later he brought out the right one. They weren't even busy inside. It was a laid back older crowd that looked like they wanted to be there all night, at least until 9pm then probably go home and sleep.

Then when they brought the correct drink there still was no soup or salad that we had ordered. We waited patiently. There was another couple that was frustrated and had to go inside to get WAITED on so we had to do the same thing. Once we explained the situation AGAIN they promptly brought out the Prime Rib first. Which was Well Done and when we ordered it they asked how we wanted it. We, of course, said medium rare. 

When I asked the wine server why these were well done and told him that we told the waiter we ordered them medium rare he told me,  ""Oh, He's Sick.""

Then came the salad and the soup. The lady that dropped it off even told us, ""See, if you come inside and get us then we get you what you need.""

The point is we shouldn't have to come inside and get you? How hard would it have been to bring a small dinner salad then 5-10 minutes later the soup. It was all backwards and all at once. They even brought me the wrong soup.

Then we had dessert and downed the Champagne and we were on our way. 

The food was forgettable and the service was not... In the worst kind of way.

This was a fantastic NYE that we had thought out the day, and unfortunately instead of me remembering our dinner as awesome. It will forever be remembered as less then stellar. Shame on the management for being so lax on the servers and shame on the serves for leaving us out in the cold on such an important day. 

This place owns us big time but I doubt we will ever be reciprocated.",2013-02-20 04:40:52

Walking down State St. on New years Eve with out of town guests and this was one of the few restaurants open. Decided to take a chance on their special: $36 for wine, soup, salad, lobster or prime rib, triffle, and champagne. 

Pro:  Lobster was plentiful and good, soup was tasty
Con: - House wine not so great. Couldn't tell the merlot from the cab and neither was 
           good.
         - Soup portion too small 
         - Prime rib was overdone/tough. Both owner and waiter explained that ""it's 
           difficult to get varying degrees of doneness within a roast""
         - triffle dessert was nothing more than fruit cocktail and jello with a smattering of
           vanilla pudding

The owner and his daughter did sing some lovely Irish ballads and he makes a point of visiting each table....he's very personable.",2013-01-01 20:38:04

The restaurant is presented in a very nice setting, outdoor sitting, clean and beautiful menus.

After that everything went downhill. After that it took 25 minutes to get our order, when the order arrived I told the waiter that we never got our salad and she apologized and asked if we still wanted the salad. Of course my respond was, Yes!  She leaves and we expect a salad within five minutes. I finish my food and the salad never arrived.

The place was not overly crowded, but they were understaffed and the service was extremely slow. I ordered a mimosa and a classic Eggs Benedict. The Mimosa was slow to arrive and even though I was nursing it, it was gone long before the Eggs Benedict arrived. The key to a good Eggs Benedict is the hollandaise sauce and there was so little sauce on it that I can't even form an opinion. Basically it was poached eggs on a slice of ham and an English muffin. The eggs, ham, and english toast were fine...  To top it off, the drink menu did not list prices, but they were making a big deal out of the fact it was ""Happy Hour,"" so while I should have asked ahead of time the $8.50 price on a tiny mimosa was a shock.

What made it frustrating was that I always had to work to get someone's attention after long waits.

I heard this place had opened and was passing by.  They have a little menu out front that caught my eye, so I popped in to check it out.  Then the next day I came back for lunch.

Their main food offering is empanadas.  They have several kinds: chicken, beef, spinach, ham, pepperoni, who knows what else.  These are mysteriously offered in ""classic"" and ""gourmet"" varieties.  As far as I can tell, the classic ones are cheaper and larger, but less fully stuffed, and perhaps with a slightly less delicate crust.  Your empanada order comes with a tasty chimichurri sauce for dipping.  They also have some sweet pastries that I haven't tried yet but that look pretty good, along with coffee and sodas.

I tried the ""gourmet chicken"" as well as the ""classic beef"".  Both were quite tasty, with a nice blend of subtle spices and a thin dough that didn't overpower the filling.  The ""classics"" are $3, which is reasonable; the ""gourmets"" are $3.40, which is a tad high considering they're smaller, but still not outrageous.  Overall a good value when you factor in their tastiness.

The vibe is so eclectic it's difficult to describe.  A huge plush empanada greets you at the doorway.  The walls are painted in large rectangles of different colors, with colored lights carefully positioned to accentuate them.  The tables where you eat are made of out old machinery, car parts, bicycle wheels, and the like.  The walls are decorated with a hodgepodge of kitsch (old license plate, collage-like art, etc.).  Dreamy techno-esque music wafts through the space.  Most unusually, the place is actually two businesses: on one side you have the counter and the seating for the empanaderia/coffee shop, but the other side of the room is a boutique with racks of clothes, handbags, and so forth.  The entire kitchen area is on wheels and appears to be a food truck layout plopped into the building.

It seems like they are still figuring out the logistics of how to operate.  The guy at the counter confirmed the empanadas are prepared elsewhere and cooked on site, but didn't know exactly where they were made.  He took my order, but then had to come back and tell me one of the ones I ordered actually wasn't available.  (He handled it fine by substituting a ""classic"" for the ""gourmet"" and refunded me the price difference.)  When asked if they had a bathroom, he hesitated before saying no.  He (as well as another woman working) there were very friendly though.  They seem to have put a great deal of care into the decoration and marketing (the printed menus are unusually nice-looking for such a modest establishment).

Overall I enjoyed Tangonadas.  The empanadas are tasty, and I can definitely see myself returning for more.  I'd also like to try their sweet pastries.  I do have one piece of advice for Tangonadas, though: you will not succeed as a coffee shop if you don't have a bathroom.  Other than that, it's a pleasantly funky place to grab a snack.",2017-02-21 22:27:29

But my god the food is mediocre. I ordered the crab melt with a side of the cheddar soup. The bread was toasted with what appeared to be Kraft cheese and in between the two slices were pieces of crab that tasted like too much mayo. On the corner of my plate were, I kid you not, RUFFLE POTATO CHIPS. Everything about my lunch screamed ""store bought."" I could have easily made this at home.
The cheddar soup was actually veggies and clams. I was confused and asked the waitress what it was and she said, ""cheddar soup you ordered."" Um. Okay. 

And yes this place is understaffed. There were 6 tables and one server. No wonder she messed up my soup order she's running around trying to please 6 tables.",2013-07-18 18:54:33

This place is the cutest! It's very small inside and not only do they sell food but it's also a unique little shop where you can purchase swim suits, trinkets, costumes, and other interesting little items. The decor is colorful and eclectic. 

They have a few tables outside so you can sit and people watch while enjoying your empanada or pastry. There's also seating provided inside as well. It reminded me of something you'd see at Disneyland very cute! 

Each empanada will cost you $2.99 and the gourmet ones are $3.40. What makes it gourmet? According to the guy behind the counter they are more flavorful, have more Ingredients and slightly bigger in size.

They do offer combos which is a good deal to sample each one. 
~ 3 empanadas of your choice + soda or coffee for $8.99 or $9.99 for ""Gourmet""

Choices are as follows: 
Chicken
Beef
Spinach & Cheese
Special/Seasonal of the day 

I opted for the gourmet chicken and regular spinach cheese empanada. I was a little disappointed in the gourmet chicken as it seemed a little skimpy filling wise but the size was slightly bigger and the crust was thicker. But I'm starting to think maybe they gave me the regular one? The spinach & cheese had more filling than the chicken and it wasn't gourmet. Both had good flavor though and the chimichurri served with them gave it a nice kick. 

I also purchased two small pastries to take home. They were the perfect treat to satisfy my sweets craving. Light, airy, flaky pastry with yummy fruit filling. I wanted the guayaba cream cheese one but unfortunately it wasn't available even though they displayed a full tray of it I was told that it was ""Sold"" and not something I could purchase. 

Overall these empanadas were freshly made and served warm and toasty. The perfect snack to try if you're on the go! I definitely will return to try the beef empanada and get that guayaba cream cheese pastry.",2017-03-26 15:43:31

My husband and I had lunch here a few days ago. The food was fine. Nothing to write home about nor complain about.  My issue is with the illegal charge that was added to my tip amount.  

I am one that monitors my account daily with my receipts.  I know this may seem trivial but the bottom line is it was an illegal act. I had to ask for my my copy of the receipt once I signed it.  

In checking my account this morning I noticed that a $3.00 amount was added to my tip amount through my online banking final amount.  I phoned my bank, we made a conference call to the restaurant and spoke with the owner Trini.  

I asked to stay on the line while she located her copy of the transaction.  She confirmed that ""I"" left a $9.00 tip. I stated that I have my original copy that ""I "" signed which was for a  ""$6.00 tip"" 

At the top of our conversation I asked if I could fax a copy of my receipt to her and she stated they did not have a fax, I asked if I could email it.  She said yes.  After she came back to the phone, she stated that she did not have an email address and wanted to mail me the money in a check. 

I stated that this was a credit card issue and I wanted her to issue a refund through her terminal.  She stated she was unable to do that. I said that I was also a merchant and know that it is possible and can be done instantly.  She then said I am not sure if I can do this today.  The time was 2:40pm.  All banking institutions are still open at this time! 

I told her at that point that I did not feel comfortable and i would exercise my right to file a dispute for the charges with my bank.  My banking institution witnessed the call and made notes and will file a formal complaint. 

Keep in mind in Santa Barbara, the majority of people do not look at price tags let alone follow up with the accurate charges. 

This was wrong!  There is no way that one can make the numeral 6 into a numeral 9 without forging it.

Argentine empanadas are on a whole other level (sorry to bust my roots). The shop is cute. Half boutique, half cafe. It's a little cramped to get through once there's more than 2 people in line. The decorations are adorable, and it feels like you're hanging out in a mini town when you sit inside. The people working there are extremely friendly and we're very attentive to the other customers who may not have had a lot of exposure to empanadas. 

They have 2 categories of regular and gourmet. Combo deals only cater towards one category so you can't mix the menus unless you buy them individually. I opted for a 3-empanada gourmet combo with coffee. Coffee was average alone, and they have a bar with assorted creamers if you're into that. The empanadas I decided to try were the gourmet beef, chicken, and caprese. They heat them to order, and the caprese did add a 10 minute wait.

Were they worth it? Definitely. My problem with empanadas is that maybe the dough is too thick or isn't flakey enough, but this was not a problem here. The chicken was seasoned and there were chopped tomatoes in it. Beef had potatoes and olives. Caprese was, well, caprese. Not quite traditional for me, but it was my favorite next to the chicken. It was like eating a huge ravioli with empanada dough, and it was honestly the best empanada experience I've had. 

I liked this place, and I could return to try the rest. It is a little expensive at 3-4 bucks a pop for small empanadas, but a good experience overall.",2017-03-01 22:09:02

They baked the empanada in small batches and they all came to the table hot and fresh.  The classic empanada had a thinner crust while the gourmet empanada had a flaky crust .  The beef filling was perfectly spiced and had moderate amount of rich and savory juice.  Just like eating a Chinese dumpling, If you let it sit for awhile, the juice will reabsorb back into the meat and will not be as delicious.  The side of chimichurri was garlicky and herbaceous.  I will definitely come back to try the other flavors.  I am deducting one star because they forgot about my order.  Maybe they should give each customer a number to streamline the ordering process.  Furthermore, every single person who came in asked about the difference between classic and gourmet.  They should consider adding that information to the menu.",2017-03-21 00:47:39

Its been so many iterations in the past that I just didn't notice when another popped up. Fortunately a friend of mine did notice and she booked our annual Holiday dinner there for a group of 9. Nothing about the look of the place will tell you this but the menu has a bit of an Irish bent to it featuring Irish Oatmeal and something called a ""Traditional Irish Breakfast"" (eggs, Irish Bacon, Sausages, Black and White Pudding, Tomatoes, Mushrooms & sweet Irish Soda Bread) on the breakfast front while offering Shepherds Pie on the dinner side. There is also a wide range of classic dishes form other cuisines ranging from shrimp scampi and chicken piccata to New York steak and a decent looking burger. Throw in a quesadilla and some nachos just to round of the international flair and flavor of the menu :-) We got an outdoor table which was quasi-indoor thanks to an awning,  clear plastic sheeting, and nice space heaters that kept us sheltered from the cold and a rare rainy night in town :-) There were a couple other large groups in that evening but we had a dedicated server and the manager/boss/owner also helped out with our group so service was fine, though one order got misplaced and arrived quite late but we were comped for it and everyone was fine with that. Food wise, I opted for the Shepherds Pie which I really enjoyed. It was nice to find something so totally different on a menu for a change. Others in the group went with the classics like the Piccata, Seafood Fettucine and Salmon.               Though I didn't get to taste anyone else's meals, plates were emptied and no complaints were lodged :-) The general consensus was these were solid takes on classic dishes. Good place to go to serve many palates and tastes and with most dishes under $20 the value is reasonable as well. Small but varied selection of local beers on tap. Didn't get to see the wine list as we brought our own, corkage was $15. Live music many nights, usually acoustic guitar with light vocals.",2016-12-19 01:43:01
kcBs2m05N9mNcOCK9JJw8Q,MtDsCRx8tRZTN8V6YMtKLA,CwL56LgcMz7Bvi4xODHVSw,3,4,2,4,"If you have ever strolled down State Street in Santa Barbara, then you are aware that it is the home of a plethora of both local and chain restaurants and cafes. It can be overwhelming to choose the ""right"" one for your eating/drinking/socializing needs. La Arcada is one of the many options to choose from. How does it stack up?

La Arcada is a cute bistro located on a corner real estate offering indoor and outdoor seating in an Irish meets Spanish- ambiance (which makes sense as the owner is Irish while his wife is Mexican). During the early afternoon, it is calm and inviting but apparently can get rowdy on weekends when there is live Irish music reverberating the air. Think: Irish bar meets cafe with rustic wood trim but stuccoed walls. 

Although La Arcada didn't have too many customers at the time of our patronage (between 2 and 3pm); I didn't feel quite that welcome. It isn't that the server and staff were rude per se; they just weren't that inviting. Not to mention: slow. Very, very slow. Despite this, we browsed the menu having not yet eaten lunch seeking some light fare. My boyfriend and I decided to share plates and went with the House Salad (Grilled chicken, fire-roasted red peppers, red onion, blue cheese, toasted pine nuts,red delicious apples and mixed greens tossed with balsamic vinaigrette-- $16.00) and the Irish Soda Bread (with Kerry Gold butter and Dubliner Cheese -- $6.00). Due to it being Happy Hour, we also shared a Bellini ($5.00). 

The key to La Arcada is presentation. The salad and bread arrived at the same time and had an elegant but approachable feel. The salad was absolutely delicious with just the right amount of vinaigrette, tender chicken, and veggies. Although it was enough for my boyfriend and I to share; I still think it was much overpriced though for the quantity. Not necessarily satisfying if you are very hungry. The Irish Soda bread was a good deal with plenty of bread and large slices of cheese. I found the bread to be a little dry (and I love Irish Soda bread so I've had it plenty of times). It wasn't awful but I wasn't blown away. The Bellini was a highlight though. It was tasty and strong which is great being that it was a happy hour price and sometimes restaurants water down drinks during those times. 

A minor note but still worth mentioning is that the bathroom is a single-stall meaning that you have to wait quite a long time if someone is inside. Plus, it is an awkward back of the house area next to run down soda machines. Not good if you really have to use the bathroom!

There honestly isn't much more to be said about La Arcada. The experience wasn't bad but also not memorable on the positive side; making it simply an okay medium-choice on State Street but not life-changing. If nothing else though, the outdoor seating is quaint with great views of State Street. I would say this is a hit or miss option in lovely Santa Barbara.",2014-11-03 20:04:25

We were here for lunch, and loved the fact that we could get outdoor seating right in the prime realty area of state street in SB, so that was a great start. Then they forgot my mom's iced tea about 4 times, and we just felt awkward having to reorder it each time. Their lunch menu isn't the cheapest in the world, but for a bistro on state street what do you expect? I got their crab melt sandwich which was overly greasy to me. I could feel the oil and cheese on my fingers way more than I wanted to, and this is coming from someone who absolutely loves cheese. It was just an okay sandwich. 

Then my mom got here french dip sandwich and when she opened it up, noticed that all of the meat had so much fat on it, she had to burn a ton of extra calories cutting away at all of the fat in her sandwich! Who wants to eat pure fat? No one pretty much. And for a sandwich of that price, that work should already be done for the consumer. Better yet, buy better quality meat without that extra fat in it!

Yes, cool they're ""0 grams of trans fat"" but they're another good brand for donuts.

Service: Fast & easy. When you're stuck at deciding which donut to grab, they'll be happy to tell you their favorites or seasonal flavor. I wasn't too hungry nor craving for a box so I went for the munchkins. The donut holes that will justify your sweet tastebuds. I got all flavors, but butternut was a definite good one right next to the glazed blueberry. 

Verdict: Hmm... hard to decide now that donuts nowadays have a crazier hype with several flavors & extraordinary combinations. As a donut fanatic, this is one of those simply grab & go, fast & easy donut shops with a higher quality taste & brand. A cleaner, new looking donut shop instead of a ""corner, by the gas station, or old fashioned"" shop. I would grab a box mainly for those who do not have dunkin donuts around them.

On a recent trip to SB i took my little nephew (i guess not so little as he is a mighty 5 years old now) to catch a movie at the Paseo Nuevo and while walking around looking for something to nosh afterwords i spied Le Macaron French Pastries.
After having spent some time at the DTLA Bottega Louie i was hooked once again on the exotic, ecstatic, luscious wonder that is the Macaron.
We bought  Belgian Chocolate, Columbian Coffee and Rose Macaron mostly because Noah liked the colors and loves chocolate in almost any form except for the beautiful hand made Ganache Chocolate Cake i made for his birthday last year. I mean that pain he inflicted on me when he nearly spat it out: i can still feel  it as i type this review. This year he gets a Vons cake!
But anyway i digress: he liked all three Macaron though i couldn't tell him he was eating rose water.
As far as i am concerned the Macaron, though they looked beautiful did not have the full bodied flavors of those from Bottega Louie. The best of the three i think is the Rose which is not a flavor to make itself apparent but it does so here.
 I didn't try all of them so i can only comment on the 3.
What i do think is pretty wonderful is the ""French Gelato."" We had the Chocolate of course and it was redolent of very fine Chocolate (callebaut?). The texture was very special: more special than Italian Gelato. It was as if i were eating the thickest French Heavy Cream ever. If you have never tasted European Butter or Cream, particularly French you really need to. It is like nothing produced in the USA.
Ok so after Noah picked me up off the floor after the Gelato tasting we noted that most of what they sell here looks like jewelry: vibrantly colored and decorated. Real show stoppers. 
We took home several Chocolate Croissants which were delicious and took me back to my time in France: flaky, multi-layered from a huge amount of very fine butter.

It's ok if there's no freebies, we were planning on paying if we had to. Just don't pretend and tell us that you'll do something for us and walk away and leave us hanging.

The line was about 20 minutes long. The environment was very cute. I like the seating areas (indoor and outdoor). Too bad it rained that day because the furniture outside were all wet. My husband likes old fashions. They didn't have any so he had to order some plains instead. I like apple fritters and I didn't see any there. We ordered 1 coffee and my husband asked for 1 cream. They put 2 creams in there. I had the caramel ice coffee. I like McDonald's Frappe or the Starbucks' Fraps or Ten Ren's caramel milk tea with boba. We had the breakfast sandwich. It was ok. Nothing special. We also bought a dozen donuts. I had to say their Boston Cream was pretty good. I brought it home for my mom and she liked it. The other donuts were nothing to rave about. We ended up tossing the donuts after a couple of days. I guess I didn't need to go to Santa Barbara for Dunkin Donuts other to see my friend because they have one in Whittier, close to home.

I wish they had more variety of donuts. Right now I still like my local mom & pop donut shop or DK Donuts of Orange (they make cronuts).",2016-07-06 15:59:03

I ordered coffee and waited and waited. Finally, I asked, ""how long does it take to pour a cup of coffee?"" I left, took the donut I ordered out of the bag and it was wet. Must not have cooled properly. Then I took a sip of coffee and it was weak-are they watering down their coffee? It did not taste like the DD coffee I'm used to.

Plus, it was 90 degrees out, and I couldn't help but think this isn't what we discovered fire for. However, I will say that didn't stop me from buying a ""s'mores"" flavor donut and attempting to roast it on the fire feature, which I now know is frowned upon by the staff.

Further differentiating his DD from those in the east coast is the executive lounge area (pictured) for Gentry and Noblemen, that wasn't labeled as such, but you could just tell a regular customer like myself wasn't allowed in unless I had some sort of access pass. I mean, it was right by the espresso bar, where executive drinks are forged.

I stuck to my class (peon) and ordered an iced coffee and the aforementioned donut. Both were of expected quality. 

The woman in front of me, before I ordered, had what appeared to be an existential crisis re: picking donut flavors, and needed in excess of 5 minutes of mumbling to herself words like ""strawberry"" and ""powdered"" before she was able to compete a six pack.

That being said, the donuts themselves were not good. This is my second time trying Dunkin (first time was in NYC) and I think there is definitely an East Coast bias. 

From this Santa Barbara location I ordered two donuts: chocolate and strawberry jelly. The chocolate one was much lighter than devil's food cake. It also had minimal glaze and on one side only. The cake itself was fluffy and bland with an artificial aftertaste. Maybe it compliments a coffee, but I just want to enjoy a lone donut sometimes, you know? 

The jelly donut was significantly smaller than usual. It was also not as good. The cake was dry and had no soft, pillowy texture. A better jelly donut can be found at other spots in town: Winchell's and Spudnuts.

What I do like about this Dunkin is the environment. I did not spot the fire pit that was in the plans, but there was ample seating both inside and outside. There was wifi too and I suggest the owner looks into improving it because it's one of the slowest on Upper State.",2016-06-10 16:19:08

My friend and I drove and eventually parked in the shopping plaza's parking structure that has the first 60-90 minutes for free. I actually didn't even know there was a shopping plaza parking structure as downtown SB always seems to be so busy that you kind of just want to avoid driving down there to avoid being stuck in traffic and/or trying to find street parking (so definitely a plus there!).

We found Le Macaron French Pastries located down one of the shopping plaza pathways near a bunch of restaurants and shops that also sold ice cream and what not. The outside of the shop looks very clean and it still looks fairly new so we were excited to try it.

Once you walk in, the glass displays show all the different types of chocolates and colorful macarons available to choose from. At a price of about $2 per macaron (definitely on the higher side considering even Lette's is $1.85/macaron), we hoped that they lived up to their hype as we purchased a couple to taste: 2 salted caramel and an espresso. As we turned to the other side, we notice that they also sold gelato in another freezer display case. We had a couple sample licks and decided we've had better so declined to order any.

After paying for our macarons, we walked outside to taste them and were definitely not highly impressed with the flavors. The expresso one was pretty decent, but the salted caramel ones tasted more heavily of chocolate fillings than the salted caramel sweet and salty mix I was expected and paid for. 

I'm glad I didn't go crazy and order a whole lot since I was more than happy to give my last salted caramel away since I didn't even wanted it after finishing the first one. 

Definitely a hit or miss I guess depending on which flavors you choose, but for me, it was a miss since the taste of my favorite flavor macaron didn't impress me at all fro this shop.",2017-04-11 07:00:40

I went into the one in Santa Barbara, which just opened the other day, and waited for what had to have been at least 20 minutes and even was solicited to put in my donut order ahead of time.

Efficient, right?

WRONG.

They completely missed my donut order.  Didn't get on the ticket, or anything.  Plus, after I ordered two breakfast sandwiches that have croissant as the bread part, they sent me to a waiting area to wait for my order.  This is fine; but after a few minutes more of waiting they belatedly tell me that they have run out of croissants.

This turned me off so much, and I'll tell you why: ANY business that is just starting out in an area (to say nothing of any business that is just opening) makes sure they have enough stock on hand to meet all orders.  You build stuff like this in, purposely, to your opening costs.

Running out of something like croissant (because let's face it - nobody likes those, right? (:-0!!) is really short sighted, bad business, bad management.

The manager apologized and acknowledged the error, but you know?

This is management 101 when you're opening a store: YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF PRODUCT.

So I would say, give these guys a look - they've got good stuff -  but maybe wait a few weeks until the hub bub dies down - or, maybe, call ahead to make sure they haven't run out of anything.

They also decided to not build a drive up window into the building, which, I mean, is a natural for traffic flow and convenience..

When I stood up and said something he didn't really care and said ""Oh I thought they weren't in line."". I would have left there feeling better if all he did was acknowledge that my kids were waiting in line. Instead, he kept saying I thought they were playing. He told me that there are other donut shops to go to if I didn't like what happened. I'm sorry but that did not sit well with me at all, considering I go there at least once a week.

1. Rose: Can't go wrong with rose - aromatic and creamy - loved how the shell was soft yet firm.
2. Colombian Coffee: Strong Colombian Coffee flavor - tastes like a mini espresso, lol!
3. Lemon Cream: Sweet and tangy, it was lovely!
4. Orange Chocolate:  You can really taste the orange flavor in this one, and the chocolate flavor balanced it out nicely.
5. Lavender Chocolate: Aromatic, but I tasted more chocolate than lavender in this one.
6. Praline: Shell shattered after first bite - taste was boring to me. 

Service: The lady helping me was nice and friendly. She answered all my questions when inquiring about the macaron flavors, and package them up nicely.

The macarons covered a rainbow of colors and flavors, but it wasn't what we were in the mood for, so we decided to move on.

If you're looking for a small post meal sweet treat this is your spot! Their macarons are definitely high quality and give just enough sweetness to kick your sweet tooth.

I'm not sure I will be back as it is a little out of my price range for something so tiny, but if they were to bring in ice cream macaron sandwiches or even just expand the size of the original products I may consider.

I have tried the double chocolate donut (my favorite here), the regular vanilla with sprinkles, pumpkin seasonal, glazed blueberry, and a few of the Munchkins and all have been decent in the bite but I totally regretted after eating it as the calories were just not worth the quality and texture of the donuts.They also very rarely have in stock the regular glazed Munchkin (donut holes) and do not ever carry glazed Old Fashioneds which are my absolute favorites.
